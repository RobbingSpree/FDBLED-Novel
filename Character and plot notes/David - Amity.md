David/Amity, 19, bio-chem student

The fool who first springs the idea when bored with their friend Gavin

Short, stocky, has been teased for being unmanly for being short and had a friend get bullied to a failed suicide attempt for expressing a desire to be trans in high school. 19, in second year of uni. Short hair (short on sides, longer on top) (that they've kept short with the intention of buying and wearing wigs but hasn't had the confidence yet due to dysphoria), well built arms from part time laborer job, same with their thighs. Reasonable hand eye coordination, poor memory for names remembers nicknames they give people easier. Considers themselves a good host above all else

Nervous and cautious when a guy, confident and generous when a girl

#### Skin tone: 
tanned, no freckles

#### Hair texture/colour:

#### Voice: 
casual and slang when thinking

#### Fashion: 
suits gyaru and skater chick fashion

#### First outfit: 
short, tight jeans. Loose grey tartan button up shirt with no buttons. Black crop top. Sports bra jammed full of pads. Black tights.

#### How treats the other (and wants to be treated in turn): 
acts like Grace and Gavin are different people. Feels their own history and position in their friend group casts a deep shadow that they can't escape even if they did get received well if they came out.

#### Reason not out as trans: 
wants to call themselves a woman and has been looking for all sorts of signs that will let them say they have crossed that barrier and become a woman. But they keep seeing it as a temporary incursion that they fall back from, essentially having a fem version of themselves and a bloke version. Kinda bi gender, very much trying to twist bioessentialist traits to support their ego.
