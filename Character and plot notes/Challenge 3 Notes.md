Chapter 3 deep notes

We join this challenge already in progress

Grace and Amity have been pressing each other to do more ladylike things for an hour

We join with them both on the precipice of a leigerie store

Amity is pressuring Grace to just have a look and MAYBE try a bra on, they're on the shelf so people try them on afterall

Grace is watching Felicity follow them from a distance sweating cause she forgot she would be dressed as Grace and can't work out what she's going to say to Flik later

Grace accepts if only to escape the gaze of Flik

Amity hands Grace a AAA bra with no support and suggest she try it on for fit

Struggle in changing room since to change a bra with a dress it requires getting essentially naked and Grace is dealing with a lot more dysphoria than she is used to experiencing and trying to dissuade Amity from coming in "you did sports, you must be used to being seen in change rooms this is nothing, I just want to make sure you're not just faking putting it on."

Shopkeep comes by asking if there's any issues and if Grace needs any help with sizing

Amity tries to press their advantage and gets the shopkeeps attention on them

Shopkeep instantly notices the heavily stacked sports bra and insists they take off the shirt and go into a change room

Grace comes back out (forgetting she's wearing the bra)
