Gavin/Grace, 19, comp sci student

A lanky human who feels ill at ease with their body and wishes someone would force fem them as they don't have the courage nor the confidence that they would look any good. When David challenges them to the first contest is far too nervous to hit the target in their panic of being found out by a friend.

Tall and thin due to genetics and terrible eating habits, never eats well and their anxiety constantly kills their appetite. They did dance for several years as a child but was bullied out of it due to toxic masculinity defining everything slightly effeminate, but they've been generally coordinated since then and played basketball as a teen for a few years before the uniforms became a bit too dysphoric. They have a quiet and higher pitched voice and might actually be intersex and don't speak much due to not feeling safe to do so.

Cat coded and relaxed when a guy, higher energy and michevious when a girl, very depressed and low energy a lot of the time, jumps to self harm when stressed

Voice: poetic and casual, michevious when presenting femme

Fashion: suits elegant long skirts and long cardigans

#### First outfit: 
loose A-line dress. Calf length cardigan

#### How treats the other (and wants to be treated in turn): 
cool and flexible and mysterious, each moment and action redefines them. Wants others to be quick to redefine them easily and without much comment.

#### Reason not out as trans: 
sees themselves as a fake woman. With the addition of their disguise (while convincing) it doesn't change who they are underneath. Has very intense body dismophia, struggles to bathe due to needing to get naked. They feel they are fooling everyone else and themselves when they crossdress. Bought into the terf idea that gender isn't something that can be changed and sees their cross-dressing and fantasies as calming a desire for living a different, easier, life.
