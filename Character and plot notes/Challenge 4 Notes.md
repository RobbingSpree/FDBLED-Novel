4: David mentions one of the rooms in their apartment is up for subletting and it would save on travel and food costs for Gavin so they can pay David back, on the condition Gavin dresses femme 24/7 and adopts their femsoma as who's living there

Chat: Flik reaches out to Aaron to ask more about the trans girl Gavin knows who refuses to deadname a trans person but also doesn't know if Grace is the person Flik is asking about or if Grace made a friend


Chapter 4:
Amity has gone to the party, pretending to have been accompanied by herself (and thus lost her in so she can ask if people have seen David and use that to start conversations)
We join the party already in progress
Amity has taken the fake name of Amy just in case word of the new girl gets back to Gavin
We join her as Amity is being very aggressively hit on by some chud
Amity was a little curious if she might be bi after the last two weeks with Gavin

Gavin at this point knows he's going to end up homeless in a week or two so that's what he's chatting to Aaron and Felicity about, he does say that if things keep going this bad he might have to leave uni for the year work to save up for next year and try again then.
This is a way for Gavin as a guy to vanish and no one to question his absence

Sees Amity and that she's being accosted
