Characters:




Aaron, 18, Art Major

Built like a brick shithouse, soft and cuddly, but can't pick up the social cues laid out for him and often grabs subtle stuff or things people want to ignore.

Felicity, 20, Art Major in Photography

A downstairs neighbour to Gavin, had her sights on Gavin as a potential egg but when Gav came to her with what sounded like another egg they could both jointly forcefem she was on board

Challenges:

1: Darts - Gavin loses

Chat: make things seem fine, Gavin throws gauntlet

2: Pool - David loses, Gavin also loses, David has no way to change back at the end to get their licence back and has to out themselves

Chat: David doesn't think walking home in girl clothes is that serious and baits a first one to flinch loses bet while walking the mall challenge from Gavin

Chat2: Flik asks Gavin about the trans girl the clothes were for and if they're as cute as planned?

3: Window Shopping - Gavin somehow ruins an expensive garment while they're trying it on and David is forced to cover the cost, Gavin now seriously owes David money. Flik turns up and meets David and aggressively flirts with them.

4: David mentions one of the rooms in their apartment is up for subletting and it would save on travel and food costs for Gavin so they can pay David back, on the condition Gavin dresses femme 24/7 and adopts their femsoma as who's living there

Chat: Flik reaches out to Aaron to ask more about the trans girl Gavin knows who refuses to deadname a trans person but also doesn't know if Grace is the person Flik is asking about or if Grace made a friend

5: Gavin wants to turn the tables and bets they can win big at blackjack and says for each $10 above what they started at David has to wear their fem clothes only for a day per. Borrows a bunch of money from their friends when they come by as it wasn't stated the money Gavin earned had to come from the game. Aaron is the first person they reach out to who helps under the provision they get their money back. Gavin agrees and has to admit to being Gavin to Aaron who acknowledges their own trans mom and brushes the idea of needing to stick to specific identities and names and he's fine with pretending he doesn't know anything about Grace so they can experiment with their identity.

Then status:

Living together, both permanently wearing fem clothes and adopting fem names, still very much want to continue cause it's a great excuse and they want to make the other pay for being kinda a bitch about it

Chapter 3 deep notes

We join this challenge already in progress

Grace and Amity have been pressing each other to do more ladylike things for an hour

We join with them both on the precipice of a leigerie store

Amity is pressuring Grace to just have a look and MAYBE try a bra on, they're on the shelf so people try them on afterall

Grace is watching Felicity follow them from a distance sweating cause she forgot she would be dressed as Grace and can't work out what she's going to say to Flik later

Grace accepts if only to escape the gaze of Flik

Amity hands Grace a AAA bra with no support and suggest she try it on for fit

Struggle in changing room since to change a bra with a dress it requires getting essentially naked and Grace is dealing with a lot more dysphoria than she is used to experiencing and trying to dissuade Amity from coming in "you did sports, you must be used to being seen in change rooms this is nothing, I just want to make sure you're not just faking putting it on."

Shopkeep comes by asking if there's any issues and if Grace needs any help with sizing

Amity tries to press their advantage and gets the shopkeeps attention on them

Shopkeep instantly notices the heavily stacked sports bra and insists they take off the shirt and go into a change room

Grace comes back out (forgetting she's wearing the bra)
