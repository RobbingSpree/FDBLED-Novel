### 10:58am Friday - Amity

SHE PLAYED ME LIKE A FIDDLE!!

This wasn't ever a bet. This was a riddle!! And she got me with my over confidence. Luck based game my left nut, this was a setup.

I tore the piece of paper off the side of the table and read it aloud.

"Hi I'm Grace. David here thinks he's being very clever, but he's agreed that for every dollar I have after eleven am (minus ten dollars) will get translated to hours and that's how long he has to crossdress and go by she/her pronouns and the name Amity (I think it suits her). So if you can run out to the nearest ATM and pull out a few hundred dollars to lend me until eleven it will be the funniest prank to pull on 'David' and be probably worth a few course credits for his Feminism class he said he was taking." These bozos have fucking cavhorted against me.

Grace leaned over and pointed to some more text along the bottom.

"P.S the closer you return to just before eleven am so David doesn't work out what the trick is, the better."

This is next level.

She fucking forcefemmed me. She convinced all our friends that as a fun Sunday prank, before I make them a nice home cooked meal, that they'd tally up...

"FOUR THOUSAND AND TWENTY NINE DOLLARS?!" I'm gonna be a girl forever. I mean, I did want that, but not like this. 

"That's a hundred and sixty seven and a half days." Grace has the biggest shit eating grin on her face. If I wasn't surrounded by other guys I'd be so turned on right now. "About five and a half months. It's a little more than I expected, but good job team. This'll knock the wind out of David's sails for a hot minute."
