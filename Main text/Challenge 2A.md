# In for a Penny

### Friday 5:55pm - David

I'm not a smart woman…I'm also pretty sure I'm still not a woman yet either.

I've not even played around with picking a more feminine name to go by, and instead today might be my last day on earth. Why didn't I look at baby name websites like those articles suggested?

So…I might be in over my head, Gavin has all rights to hold a grudge. I dressed him up like a girl Saturday…and…I mean…I did kinda also try to put him in a skirt on Sunday…and I'm very glad he didn't ask where I was going to get a skirt from at short notice (that really felt like a slip up on my part, no one can know about the shame skirt I bought and am too afraid to wear).

And here I am, five minutes early and Gavin is nowhere to be seen. And like…I might be cooked.

Last time I had the benefit of surprise and being the mastermind of the plan. Can I really trust he's not going to take things too far with this? I know how good he is at darts, that's why I challenged him to darts. I have never seen him play a game that requires this much dedicated space. This is his plan, and his chosen sport…do I stand any chance of making it out of this with any dignity?

So, to recap: not only did I not manage to play at being a woman last week…this week I think Gavin is going to cast my role as something incredibly unflattering instead.

I can hardly fathom what cunning plan Gavin has or if they're going to jump out at me in the next five minutes.

### Friday 5:59pm - Gavin

I think I fucked up. This plan has no chance of working. Especially not with me at the helm.

I've been sitting down here in the cool and out of the sun for like twenty minutes and one of the staff just came by to check I wasn't asleep. I tried to tell them I was here to play a game, that I'm just waiting for David to show up…but I just don't have the confidence (and I don't really like my voice) to say things that loud. So now they're having a bit of a chat amongst themselves behind the counter.

Was I dozing? Yes. But that should be encouraged. If customers are well rested we would play for longer.

Also, I have to look it up later but do pool halls also have a thing with jazz? Cause that's the background music here too! Am I just being haunted by jazz? The dulcet tones of sax solos and piano plinking.

I check my brick of a phone and notice two missed calls from David. If I actually cared about answering calls I'd save up for a newer device…one with a ringtone that is audible (but after last week I've decided I'm saving up for another dress first). I got today's outfit cause I sold Felicity on the chance she could try and date whoever I get to wear it…an unlikely result when Flik is a through and through lesbian and David is…David…but if she has forcefem desires who am I to not make David squirm when I benefit from them.

I can't sneeze at free clothes, whatever the caveat they came with. I did not have the funds to buy a whole outfit for today, especially not one this well planned.

I start punching in a message telling David to wait for me inside the pool hall (where I already am, but he doesn't need to know that yet). And once again I lose confidence in my plan.

I'm gonna what? Finesse David like a common pool hustler? And make them wear the outfit and he just goes along with it? I don't even know David's sizes, these will likely not fit and the whole plan goes out the window when only I have something to lose. I put those clothes on last week cause I was kinda curious what someone else's idea of dressing femme was, what reason does David have for playing along? Sportsmanship?

He was calling cause he was already here…right?

He wasn't calling to cancel…right?

He has to know this is a follow up to last week, and that by rights he started this so it's only fair I get a shot at evening the playing field of blackmail. I can only assume the whole thing was for blackmail purposes, unless David swings that way and actually thought I looked good. I mean…I did look good. Even Aaron said so and he doesn't have a ounce of guile in his blood. But did David want to dress me like a girl the whole time? How long had he been planning it?

It's fine that I got Flik involved then.

Forcefem me, shame on you. Forcefem you back…err…we all are free of shame?

Nah, vengeance back on. I'm gonna beat David, take a photo of him in drag and then use it to blackmail him and get like…fifty bucks from him to cover my food bills for the next fortnight.

Assuming he is coming.

I hope he is coming.

Cause he didn't actually reply since yesterday when I challenged him to turn up. Just those two calls I missed. And he's not replied to the message either, nor given another call back.

I just gotta hope he's as much of a good sport as I give him credit for being.
