# Not as fun without her
### 6:54pm Friday - ~~Amity~~ Amy

I was so fucking wrong! On so many levels! 

This just isn't as fun when I'm dressed like a girl by my self. I don't know how but Gavin made this fun, especially when we were trying to make the other regret existing. But I don't have the same butterflies in my stomach feelings that I got with him. I don't to be seen, or spoken too, or have people be in my space. Riddle me that, bitch.

Second of all the fuckery I'm living through: I'm not gay. Or am I? Whatever! I don't like dudes. This chud has been blocking me in and pinning me to a wall for the last ten minutes and doing nothing but talk about himself while he tries to flirt with me. Does he know I'm trans? Does he think I'm cis? Doesn't matter either way, he's a wanker. Grace could make it seem elegant and cool, like I could leave if I wanted to, that it was her entrancing eyes and...it doesn't matter why! This guy is doing it so wrong I'm never going to give another guy the time of day after this. 

The utter dumpster of a man here told me his name when he introduced himself, but since I think this is the third time he's circled back to talking about golf I don't know if knowing his name would make suffering through this any easier. I hope to all that is dangerous and caustic that I was never this bad when I tried to flirt with ladies. I can't even use my drink running out as an excuse to leave, cause he gave me a drink when he first approached me, and while I don't know what rohypnol smells like, I don't trust a drink I didn't get myself.

I came here to try and have more fun as a girl and see if with a little spit and polish I could make a convincing girl. I already felt like one under Grace's gaze (heh...gays) but I don't know if that was just one fluke after another. I couldn't stop noticing the makeup on the walk over, but now with the music blaring and the people moving and this wank-stain looming over me, my makeup and outfit are the last thing on my mind. I Don't know if it's worth giving up and turning in for the night, if it's just gonna be more chud-like men hitting on my like this, I think I've had my fill.

It almost makes me regret coming up with a fake name to go by in case I meet anyone I already know or someone else complains about me. I don't want the name Amity getting back to Grace and her finding out I came here alone. 

That feels wrong somehow.

### 7:06pm Friday - Gavin

"So you're just gonna be homeless then?" Real fucking subtle Felicity.

"I'm not going to be homeless, I'll just end up going home. I have a home at home."

"At your parent's place?" Don't give me that look Aaron, I don't want pity.

"No, I'm going to move in with my sister. She's not close enough that I can do classes, but I can do all my paperwork stuff in person rather than over the phone or something."
