# Not as fun without her
### 6:54pm Friday - ~~Amity~~ Amy

I was so fucking wrong! On so many levels! 

This just isn't as fun when I'm dressed like a girl by my self. I don't know how but Gavin made this fun, especially when we were trying to make the other regret existing. But I don't have the same butterflies in my stomach feelings that I got with him. I don't to be seen, or spoken too, or have people be in my space. Riddle me that, bitch.

Second of all the fuckery I'm living through: I'm not gay. Or am I? Whatever! I don't like dudes. This chud has been blocking me in and pinning me to a wall for the last ten minutes and doing nothing but talk about himself while he tries to flirt with me. Does he know I'm trans? Does he think I'm cis? Doesn't matter either way, he's a wanker. Grace could make it seem elegant and cool, like I could leave if I wanted to, that it was her entrancing eyes and...it doesn't matter why! This guy is doing it so wrong I'm never going to give another guy the time of day after this. 

The utter dumpster of a man here told me his name when he introduced himself, but since I think this is the third time he's circled back to talking about golf I don't know if knowing his name would make suffering through this any easier. I hope to all that is dangerous and caustic that I was never this bad when I tried to flirt with ladies. I can't even use my drink running out as an excuse to leave, cause he gave me a drink when he first approached me, and while I don't know what rohypnol smells like, I don't trust a drink I didn't get myself.
