# Learning and Growing

### Friday 6:21pm - Gavin

I was wrong. I am wrong. This is wrong.

I hope there was no mirror in that toilet, cause if I came out looking that good I would have simply strut all the way home no questions asked. Fuck these bets, if I looked that good I'd start transitioning right then and there.

I tried on some of those clothes to check if they were long enough on the torso. I know guys and girls grow slightly different…but damn! How is she doing that? He? They? How do you think about your friend when they look like a smoking hot lady? Is there a precedent? What would I even look up? "Friend sexy lady help", "am I gay if they look like a lady?", "how to take photos with your mind".

The top, that fit fine on me, is now a body-hugging crop top on them. The shorts, which were baggy and hid body contours on me, just screams banging thighs on them. The tights, outstanding, no notes, somehow makes them look ephemeral and wisp-like but also the different darkness that is their legs and the shadows of the dim room hint at their silhouette. When they entered the room, for a moment they were illuminated by the spotlight highlighting the doorway, and they looked like they had stepped out onto a runway. I'm so glad our table is nowhere near that entrance cause David would have heard me gasp. And to top it all off, the plaid button-up dress that I cut all the buttons off of, so it's essentially a coat with a lady's cut. It hugs in the right spots and flares in the others. It didn't look this good on me, this is entirely unfair.

I've made a monster.

You'd wouldn't think David's mop of hair on top and the close crop on the sides makes them look like an utter lesbian. But with this outfit, they now just look like a stereotypical butch. I swear I've met three lesbians this year who had that exact haircut, how has no one teased them about that? It's really obvious at the moment.

I have to pull it together. If they catch me staring they'll be weirded out or disgusted.

"Fought the tights to the bitter end?"

"Some wanker…!" Ohh no, how do they sound hot too? Is this how they normally sound? Relax, Grace, calm and composed, no one can shake you. "Barged in just as I finished getting these things on…" David pulls at the tights, but I refuse to take my eyes from their face, they'll be able to see a blush from this close, calm clear ocean. "And fucking threw up in the sink where all my dude-clothes were sitting."

I hadn't even noticed they had come back empty handed.

They have to go home like that. Sucked in, you tosspot. Serves you right for springing the same thing on me last week. Don't look happy that you get to see her…I mean him in this outfit for the rest of the night. I can't let anything show on my face. I must be calm and neutral.

"So…we'll have to change the terms then. If I lose the next game, I'll change clothes, if you lose…" I didn't actually think this far, what else can I threaten them with. I don't want blackmail of them dressed like this, people will just think I took a sneaky pic of a lady (also I don't want the temptation of looking at this stunning creature when I'm lonely and horny).

Can I get any ideas from them?

Nope.

No.

Can't look directly at them.

They're so good looking. How are they so good looking? How do they make looking that good look so effortless? What do you even call someone who looks like that? Not a siren (though their voice is nice). Not a she-devil. Not…

"If you lose, I pick a name you go by while you're dressed like this."

I have to look at her -er I mean…him. Them? Fuck. How do I think about them? Gotta stay cool and look them in the eyes.

Ahhhhhhhh!

### Friday 6:34pm - David

"Best three out of four!" Grace slammed her hand on the pool table, announcing her return. "Same rules as before, except you get blackmail if you win, I pick your name of you don't." She doesn't have her normal cool vibes. She has this wild grin I've never seen Gavin wear, like she knows the future. Her cardigan flutters when she moves. I never saw that last week, I don't think I was watching any time she moved. She looks so elegant and cool but has this energy of a fairy who can outwit me with a single well placed word.

I played the game of my life just now, I really didn't want Gavin picking my name…but Grace? For some reason I want to trust her more. Even if she's the same person…how does that work?

"Do you not think a pic of this is worth all that?" How does she sound so different to Gavin? She can't know I like her more as a girl. People finding out I want to be a woman would be bad but this…whatever this is, what was the word Gavin used? Forcefeming my friend. No one can know I want this. That would make me…an unmitigated pervert or something, and I don't know how that would colour how everyone sees visiting my house. But it really can't be seen as a good thing.

Wait…what did she say before? I forgot. Gotta play it cool, I think it was a question, so let's try and slow roll her and she might repeat herself.

"No…more…please?"

Okay.

Right.

That was somehow the wrong answer.

She is bushing all the way to her ears.

I don't think I've ever seen Gavin blush. Grace is so much more fun to play with. I can't get carried away, if I find out why I got this reaction I might never stop teasing her.

"We'll decide when I win." All I can do is just play the next game and hope they complain about whatever I just asked for so I can walk it back.

### Friday 6:56pm - Gavin

This has been the closest game of pool I've ever played. Has it been a well played game? No. Does it help that both David and I are utterly raw nerves and keep making back to back mistakes? Yes, cause we're equally matched now.

I can't get the memory of them coyly asking for risque photos of me out of my head. Who fucking asks like that? Tilted head like she -er they didn't think it was serious ask. And I almost agreed! That's the worst bit! That I almost caved just cause she's cute. They! He! Fuck! Yeah, it's just a cis dude who I accidentally dressed up like a bombshell, don't even let it get to you, Grace.

I know I look good like this, surely I must be having some kind of impact on him too. It can't just be a one way street. Why else would they be playing so poorly?

David's just looking at me. What does my face looks like? Am I smiling? It's really hard to not smile while I'm wearing this dress. Is it my turn? Okay! Focus, Grace, it's your game to win. We're down to the eight ball, David has two to go. I've got no good lines to call.

Wait…let me check the rules on the wall…

Yeah, I can snooker him instead.

"Top left pocket." Calling with no intention to sink is a party fowl, but not illegal.

The eight ball gently bounces off the top bumper while the cue ball ends up perfectly near one of the balls David has yet to sink. There's an easy line to sink it next turn, at the other end of the table. And the eight ball gently slips between them and stops right next to the middle pocket.

That could have gone poorly for me, but now its impossible for anyone to call fowl. If it went in any pocket but the one I called I would have lost (not that I could have made the called shot with how poorly I've been playing). Now David faces a choice, take the risky shot and maybe sink the eight ball (losing him the game), or try for a long shot back off the top bumper to even reach the other ball he needs.

I've got this in the bag, David has been so confident all game, even when he's been playing like an earthquake is happening exclusively when he goes for a shot. Does he have some excuse he's been selling himself on to keep that confidence up?

Well, I'll just take a spot at the far end. Taunt him with how entirely plausible this shot is. How, if he just keeps his cool he won't land a glancing bump on the eight ball and lose the game on the spot. He can see it. He's looking at me. And I'm all smiles. Nothing to see. Just another classic mistake from Grace, feel free to take advantage of it.

He's looking at the other ball, he has no confidence in that shot, his every thought is written on his face. He's as easy to read as jazz isn't. He looks back at me…okay, maybe he isn't easy to read cause he looks kinda aroused, and who gets off on losing at games?

He shoots.

Game, set, match.

Grace wins. Fatality!

I snatch the cue ball off the table, we don't need to wait for it to finish moving. That plonker sunk the eight. I grab the other two balls and quickly arrange the rest of the balls in the plate we got them on. The clock says we're out of time and I agree with it.

Did I kinda want to lose so in could find out what David meant when they asked for more than just blackmail photos? Yeah. But I came here to win, and that's what I'm going to do.

"I'll take that." I snatch David's cue before he can threaten me with it, I don't expect him to, but I did want to push him further than he pushed me last week. So one always has to be ready for that to be too far. "And we'll head back out. You're gonna have a fun time convincing the staff that your photo ID is yours."

"Why?" David, you soft, sexy, foolish, summer child. You might not know how different you look, on account of the lack of mirrors or shadows cast anywhere but the floor.

"I bet you they ask if David left earlier and if we can give him the ID back." Using the cues I Shepard David back to the front counter.

"Evening Ladies. Have a good game?"

"I won, so yes." Can't let David say anything, I don't want them to spoil this. Just hand the gear in, it has the table number on it, they will look it up and ask the question I want them to. They'll play right into my hands.

Wait…

If they have to look at a table list there's a few seconds where David has time to get their brain in gear and talk. I can't let them talk. How can I stop their brain?

I turn to look at my victim. I can see them recovering from the deer in headlights shock of being called ladies. Hey! They did do that! I'm ladies! Shush girl. The brain is thinking. I must turn David to mush for a few seconds, how can I do that?

He…he did look like he was aroused earlier…right? Did he want to forcefem me this whole time? Can I fight fire with fire? No, I have no idea how to forcefem someone. But I can burn him with that fire.

If he thinks I'm a girl (cause I kinda am, let's agree here), then we'll see how well the least honed feminine wiles cut.
