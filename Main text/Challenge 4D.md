# A heart that burns for you may leave a scar

### 7:11pm Friday - ~~Amity~~ ~~Amy~~ Amity

The chud left after only a few seconds of kiss. 

Good.

Her lips are very soft. I can feel her panicking while I hold her in place. But she's not not kissing back. My Grace is in there and she wants me too.

### 7:15pm Friday - Gavin

(To write later, need a bit where Gavin is shellshocked and a bit upset that Amity took their first kiss, but also starts trying to explain it away and dismiss it as not that serious. All the while Amity is dragging him out of the party and over to the bus stop to take him to her house.)

### 8:40pm Friday - ~~Amity~~ ~~Amy~~ ~~Amity~~ Enmity

"Stop being a baby and tell me what you mean."

"I was just saying it'll be a weird way to part ways after tonight."

"Yeah, but I'll see you on Sunday and it'll keep being weird then too." Gavin, why do you look like you are the one who did something wrong?

"Right...so you know how I'm broke all the time?"

"Yeah, that's why you're at every Sunday dinner. You're reliable." 

Don't go.

"Well...my landlord has been raising my rent and I've fallen behind, and: surprise! I get evicted tomorrow. Sooooooo...I'm going to move home."

Don't take her from me.

"You okay? Why are you taking this news worse than I did? Flick, you met her last week, she talked me out of just being homeless and trying to finish the semester. You don't want to know what the police do to homeless uni students. So I'm kinda out of options."

You're doing this on purpose.

"I'm not getting my deposit back, so I can't afford another deposit on anywhere else. Even if there was somewhere I could stay."

Stay here.

"Stay here."

"What on your couch?" Don't be cute, Gavin.

"We've got a room. We were just using it for storage, but you could stay here. I can sublet to you." I want her here. "There would be conditions, but you wouldn't have to pay a deposit or rent at first."

"I don't care what the conditions are. I was this close to either being murdered by the police or moving in with my sister. I'll take any conditions over that." Don't say ANY. I'll take advantage of your naivete. Don't let me do this. 

"Gentlemen's agreement then? Free board for some small changes." Don't agree. Don't let me trap you. I already feel terrible for that kiss. All I could see was her. Once I got close enough. Don't let me see her again, I don't know what I'd do next.

"Done." I'm a terrible person. "So what's the conditions? I'm happy to earn my place. Or wear a shirt that says 'Bludger' on it or something." 

Maybe if I come on too strong I'll scare them off. Just tear the breaks off and barrel full steam ahead.

"Well...I'd be inviting Grace to stay, not Gavin." That's the same expression I saw when I first thought I was clever. "The other people I room with don't like sharing their space with guys. I got a pass cause they were desperate and I proved myself. But they don't know you. Theyre too busy when the Sunday dinners are on, so they've not met Gavin and would probably veto you staying." 

"So...I just have to dress like a girl at your place."

"And answer to Grace, like you normally do when dressed that way."

"But I can change again if I step out?"

"As long as you don't do it in a really obvious way. I'm betraying their trust too. If you get caught then I do too and we'll both be homeless."

"Sure. Even if it's just till the end of the semester. I've put up with worse." Don't drop depressing lore at the end of a conversation like it's nothing. And don't be a tease. "I don't have girl clothes on hand obviously, so I'll pack up and come back tomorrow then?"

"We'll have to buy you more girl clothes. One pair won't be enough."

"I'm gonna have to write even more IOUs"
