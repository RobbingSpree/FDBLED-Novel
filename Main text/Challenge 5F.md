# Don't Kiss or Make Up

### 9:58pm Sunday - Amity

"Nice to meet you properly Grace, and I'll chat to you later...Amity." Fuck you Aaron. 

I turn on Grace now the apartment is empty, I've got about thirty minutes before the pharmacology wonder twins return and need to get some things straight...if we ignore the gay urges.

"So was that the totality of your scheme?"

"I was gonna tell Mar and Jell too if it went well, they were oddly onboard as soon as I mentioned the plan this morning before you got up. If I'm trapped like this it seems only fair that you be too. What are their actual names by the way?"

Don't hit her. We don't hit women...wait...I'm a women now. Am I allowed to hit Grace? Assault is still a crime...so no?

Wait...this apartment is now nothing but women. This was my dream when I imagined what university life would be like. Before I get stuck on that thought, I need to do something about Grace winning today. It can't be a total victory, my pride won't allow it.

Only I'm allowed to win uncontested.

What was the exact rules she said? For every dollar and hour, but if I was ahead...

"Hey Grace..." She stops washing the plates and turns to look at me, her perfect crooked smile still dancing on her lips. "So the rules were if I finished ahead of my starting total..." I leave the sentence there and wait for her to join me at the obvious conclusion.

All she said, was if I was ahead I could have any favour. She even threatened a kiss. Those terms weren't mutually exclusive, both of us were capable of 'winning' under the rules she proposed. I don't know if she intended to this or not, or if her mentioning the kiss was just to distract me (it worked for sure).

I can't tell if she's blushing with how dark her skin tone is, but she is trying to avoid eye contact and turn back to do more washing. Her deft fingers keep dropping the plates, she really does seem to have a tell when she gets flustered.

I just wanted to put a little pressure back on her after the magnitude of today's loss, but now I think she might have actually wanted that second kiss.

I'm not even emotionally prepared to follow through on the threat, I'm not wearing nearly nice enough clothes or my false boobs. Gavin only ever mentioned an interest in girls, but they did get along suspiciously well with some of my past girlfriends. Are they actually gay? Gay for guys, not gay for girls. Do I count as a guy or a girl in their mind? Are they gay for me or gay-gay for me? Do they like me at all or are they just into kisses? How can I answer any of these questions without yielding any of the pressure I just found?

I just wanted to tease them...where did this romantic tension come from?

Wait...is it an act? They're friends with other girls, they could have just learned how to imitate that look. 

Without seeming obvious I'll just have another quick peek at their face and see if they've dropped the act.

Nope.

It was an act.

Fuck me, I guess.

I'm just gonna go shut myself in my room and calm down.

Literally crying over the possibility of a second kiss? It must have been the dark and the party vibes  on Friday that made me think I was at all desirable.

### 9:59pm Sunday - Grace

Tonight was actually really nice.

No one made any untoward comments or hinted that they knew I was a guy. Other than having no plan for classes tomorrow or how to pay for tuition next week things are looking up.

I always left well before this point of the evening to dumpster dive behind the super market, it's so chill and quiet. Very reminiscent of the day a few weeks ago when Amity first challenged me to darts, quiet but with the soft sound of people moving about.

It's just Amity and me now, I'm elbow deep in the dishes and Amity's been wiping down all the surfaces. I didn't know how nice it is to work WITH someone else. Maybe I don't need to keep up my guard every moment I'm with Amity now...maybe I can trust her a little.

"Hey Grace..." Her voice cuts into my mind, I don't know why she sounds so different since I won earlier, she's not even wearing her normal girl clothes that accompanies this voice. She's got a very sly look on her face, did she find something one of the guys left behind? "So the rules were if I finished ahead of my starting total..." 

What? Wait...what? Think Grace, what did you say? I was trying to stop her from asking any more questions. What did I say? 

If she was ahead...she could have any favor...even...a second...

She's so close. When did she get so close?

Does she want a kiss now? Now!? When my arms are covered in soap suds? And I keep dropping plates!! God damn, Amity! Keep it in your pants. Why are you continuing this joke? You date girls, I've met them. I'm not...

Am I not?

No one said otherwise today. Mar and Jell said I was a girl a bunch of times. And Amity only dates girls...

Am I girls?

I am...aren't I?

I'm a girl.

I'm a girl I'm a girl I'm a girl I'm a girl!!

Fuck, why was this the thing I cry at? At least it's over the sink so Amity doesn't have to wipe down another surface.

Maybe I just tell Amity the truth...wait... where'd she go?

What a tease, if she's going to be like that then I can play that game too.
