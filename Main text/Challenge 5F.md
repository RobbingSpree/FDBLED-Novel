### 9:58pm Sunday - Amity

"Nice to meet you properly Grace, and I'll chat to you later...Amity." Fuck you Aaron. 

I turn on Grace now the apartment is empty, I've got about thirty minutes before the wonder twins return and need to get some things straight...if we ignore the gay urges.

"So was that the totality of your scheme?"

"I was gonna tell Mar and Jell too if it went well, they were oddly onboard as soon as I mentioned the plan this morning before you got up. If I'm trapped like this it seems only fair that you be too. What are their actual names by the way?"

Don't hit her. We don't hit women...wait...I'm a women now. Am I allowed to hit Grace? It's still a crime...so no?

Wait...this apartment is now nothing but women. This was my dream when I imagined what university life would be like. Before I get stuck on that thought, I need to do something about Grace winning today. It can't be a total victory, my pride won't allow it.

Only I'm allowed to win uncontested.

What was the exact rules she said? For every dollar and hour, but if I was ahead...

"Hey Grace..." She stops washing the plates and turns to look at me, her perfect crooked smile still dancing on her lips. "So the rules were if I finished ahead of my starting total..." I leave the sentence there and wait for her to join me at the obvious conclusion.

All she said, was if I was ahead I could have any favour. She even threatened a kiss. Those terms weren't mutually exclusive, both of us were capable of 'winning' under the rules she proposed.
