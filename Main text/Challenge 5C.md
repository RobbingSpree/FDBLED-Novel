# Reversal of Fates

### 8:23am Sunday - Grace

I didn't see Amity all morning. Or David. I should expect to see David, cause he lives here and Amity is a figment of my imagination that I've projected onto my friend.

Anyway, I've finished all the setup for my plan to make Amity real. Now it's just a matter of time.

Having been coming to David's house for a year or so for Sunday dinners I'm well aware that dinner starts at ten AM sharp. Not the eating part, but the socialising part. David always said it was when the house was finally ready to use and now I know the real reason. The reason was sitting across from me at the table eating far too much breakfast for my tastes.

"So, Grace, when did you meet David, cause he hasn't mentioned you." Okay, that's a great question. Do I lie here or tell more half truths? I really should be taking notes so we can be on the same page later. The more true the easier it'll be to remember.

"About a fortnight ago. He was...showing me his skill at darts."

"No, before that. What did he say to get you to walk up six flights of stairs and into a stranger's house." That's an excellent question, that doesn't make sense unless I already knew him.

"I dunno." The most reliable answer: the truth.

"Girl, you are waaaay too trusting." I'm more amazed neither of these two have sused out that I'm not a girl. "Mar, we have to protect this pure creature."

Okay, so these two may have forgotten to introduce themselves, but in their defence so did I. But I have worked out that that one is Jell and the other is Mar. Neither of those sound like human names, especially not for a girl. So I have no idea what to actually call them, cause I don't think I'm allowed to use their nicknames in the same hour after meeting them.

"I saw her sunbathing earlier. She might just be a cat in disguise." Don't react to that...they might think you are a cat in disguise. "And I know you're small in the chest but you should put on a bra with something sleeveless, this place will be crawling with guys later...and David will wake up eventually."

Yeah, fair cop. I just really liked the shirt-thing from among Stuff David got me yesterday. I really was expecting he'd ask me to put on a fashion show after the last two times he got me to put on clothes. But instead he just left to buy ingredients for this evening. So I got to try a bunch on in private (in private but David did bring the giant mirror so I could check myself out). I don't remember the actual name of this, but it looks like the vergin-killer jumper and I liked the idea of pretending to be sexy. After this is done I'll fight with the bra I stole and see if it's an improvement.

"Yeah..." Jell is doing an impressive job talking with a mouthful of eggs and only making me a little nauseous. "...a few weeks of eating David's food you'll start to put some weight on your body. I can see your ribs, girl" Don't respond. I know I said I would cry next time the opportunity arose, but that's not it. Just pretend you get called a girl all the time and it's not heart-warming. 

"I was planning a quick game with David later, with something fun at stake and wanted to get your opinion first to see if you think he'd be against it or not...or if you think he deserves it."

The pair of them lean in close.

"Go on."
