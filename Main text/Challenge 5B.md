# Who am I to Her?

### 10:31am Saturday - ~~Amity~~ David

I don't know if this is a crush or if I feel like her mom. 

Like...who wants to spoil their friends and buy them clothes and nice things? Regardless, going out this morning and doing a quick run back down to the second hand shop was the right decision. I don't want to show off Grace walking down the street with David. I want to show her off as mine when I'm Amity. Not that she's mine. She's her own woman. Man...thing? Just gonna stick with woman, it's more important to not get confused and out her than be respectful about pronouns.

I don't know how to show her off on Amity's arm now though. With Grace living here also I won't have any reliable alone time to be Amity at home, let alone practice makeup. How am I supposed to explain that? Tell her the truth? She'll assume I'm some kind of sex pest making her do this. And I don't want to try and bait her into punishing me so I can crossdress. I don't want Grace to have a bad opinion of me cause I taunted her (and I still have to work off the bad reputation my choices last night saddled me with).

She was so soft and delicate in my hands though. I'm gonna have to find out what other girlfriends or boyfriends Grace has had to know if they're liable to come back and try to claim her again. 

Okay, banishing evil thoughts and returning to her side looking sane and normal.

Back in the storage room Grace has finished unpacking her everything. A digital clock, a laptop, a ratty looking blanket they're folding back up, some clothes and that's it. What was in the second bag? Scouring the room I don't see anything different. The only thing out of place is the floor chair that no one used that has been set out like a low quality mattress. Wait. Pillow. They dedicated a whole bag to their pillow. 

"Did you not own any manchester?"

"The city?" Don't be cute, Grace. 

"The bed sheets." Tell me you just threw them out cause they were as worn through as your shoes and you weren't sleeping on bare mattresses.

"Don't need one without a mattress." Grace. I will make you sleep on my bed and I'll take the couch at this rate. I thought those pictures of guy's apartments with no furniture and a bare mattress on the floor were just jokes people captured while moving in or out. Grace, you're showing how there's always someone more bizarre than you can imagine, thank you.

"Okay...well setting that aside for later." If I don't move on I will really turn into her mom and start doting on her. "Can you try on some of the clothes I brought you? You can't...won't...aren't allowed to only wear one outfit."

"I was thinking about that. I think some of my...as you called them: shame clothes."

"..." Biting my tongue! Biting my tongue! Biting my tongue! Don't make a joke. Don't say you can make her feel shame and like it. Don't. Keep it in. That's only something Amity is allowed to say. And even that's probably a step too far. Don't look at her lips! Bad girl! Boy...man...thing.

"See?" Go on, twirl. It's fun. Those shorts are baggy enough to almost be a skirt. "It looks fine."

"I don't know how to say this...but you look like a different person from the waist down." You really look like someone tore a barbie doll in half and stuck a random other doll's legs in its place.  "Those pants don't fit you. I didn't notice before cause it was uniform with how it hung on you. But you did kinda look like you wear a cloud, or a shadow." 

"It's just what I feel comfortable in. Stuff that's like a blanket, all safe and wrapped up." 

"I can't vibe with that. My clothes need to be respectable." Though, if I look at what I've been wearing as Amity...I might need to re-evaluate that idea. "But you have to admit, clothes that fit you can look good."

"That's not as wise as you think." Don't smile at me like that Grace...I NEED to not look at your lips and you're making that a lot harder than it could be. "Of course well fitting clothes look good, we've all seen runway models. We've been propagandized to like that." And you don't think it has something to do with you looking like one of those runway models that you look good?

"Setting aside the male gaze."

"What did they ever do to warrant being discarded." Grace, I mean it. Stop being cute. Or so help me I will go put on my emergency skirt that's still in the bag I bought it in and come back in here and kiss you again.

I can be calm. I can be normal. I'm not at all having improper thoughts about someone I'm giving shelter to.

"Setting aside how a lot of fashion is marketed under the assumption that it's only worth looking good to a male perspective. You were probably due for a wardrobe refresh. I doubt your sister would even recognise you without your trademark beanie let alone the rest of the stuff you're wearing."

"Good job remembering the course material, that almost sounded sensible. That does raise a question though: what do I do tomorrow? Just hide in here all day and eat leftovers when it's done?"

"What? No! You're as thin as a rake and I can smell how little you ate for breakfast, you're not missing any more meals."

"I told everyone I was leaving for good yesterday. Cause as far as I knew that's what I was doing. And now you've said I HAVE TO dress like this for room and board. I don't think everyone will assume I'm some new chick. They're not as thick as Aaron."

"Aaron has good opinions, he's a good egg."

I just have to think of something before tomorrow, it'll be fine.

I have no ideas and have doomed Grace to ridicule and isolation.

This is a perfect idea and will solve everything!
