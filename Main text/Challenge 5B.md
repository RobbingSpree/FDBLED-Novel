# Reversal of Fates

### 8:23am Sunday - Grace

I didn't see Amity all morning. Or David. I should expect to see David, cause he lives here and Amity is a figment of my imagination that I've projected onto my friend.

Anyway, I've finished all the setup for my plan to make Amity real. Now it's just a matter of time.

Having been coming to David's house for a year or so for Sunday dinners I'm well aware that dinner starts at ten AM sharp. Not the eating part, but the socialising part. David always said it was when the house was finally ready to use and now I know the real reason. The reason was sitting across from me at the table eating far too much breakfast for my tastes.

"So, Grace, when did you meet David, cause he hasn't mentioned you." Okay, that's a great question. Do I lie here or tell more half truths? I really should be taking notes so we can be on the same page later. The more true the easier it'll be to remember.

"About a fortnight ago. He was...showing me his skill at darts."

"No, before that. What did he say to get you to walk up six flights of stairs and into a stranger's house." That's an excellent question, that doesn't make sense unless I already knew him.

"I dunno." The most reliable answer: the truth.

"Girl, you are waaaay too trusting." I'm more amazed neither of these two have sused out that I'm not a girl. "Mar, we have to protect this pure creature."

Okay, so these two may have forgotten to introduce themselves, but in their defence so did I. But I have worked out that that one is Jell and the other is Mar. Neither of those sound like human names, especially not for a girl. So I have no idea what to actually call them, cause I don't think I'm allowed to use their nicknames in the same hour after meeting them.

"I saw her sunbathing earlier. She might just be a cat in disguise." Don't react to that...they might think you are a cat in disguise. "And I know you're small in the chest but you should put on a bra with something sleeveless, this place will be crawling with guys later...and David will wake up eventually."

Yeah, fair cop. I just really liked the shirt-thing from among Stuff David got me yesterday. I really was expecting he'd ask me to put on a fashion show after the last two times he got me to put on clothes. But instead he just left to buy ingredients for this evening. So I got to try a bunch on in private (in private but David did bring the giant mirror so I could check myself out). I don't remember the actual name of this, but it looks like the vergin-killer jumper and I liked the idea of pretending to be sexy. After this is done I'll fight with the bra I stole and see if it's an improvement.

"Yeah..." Jell is doing an impressive job talking with a mouthful of eggs and only making me a little nauseous. "...a few weeks of eating David's food you'll start to put some weight on your body. I can see your ribs, girl" Don't respond. I know I said I would cry next time the opportunity arose, but that's not it. Just pretend you get called a girl all the time and it's not heart-warming. 

"I was planning a quick game with David later, with something fun at stake and wanted to get your opinion first to see if you think he'd be against it or not...or if you think he deserves it."

The pair of them lean in close.

"Go on."

### 9:49 am Sunday - ~~Amity~~ David 

This can't be happening. What is she thinking?

"I'm sorry? What?"

"Well, since I'm stuck like this it only seems fair that you help disguise me by being a more overt curiosity." 

"And how does that equate to me cross-dressing too?"

"Only if I win, and I have to win well. And it likely won't be for long." Don't tempt me with a good time during a hurricane, Grace. I'm crazy enough to go for it. "We'll play poker, I'll start with ten dollars, and you can bring as much money to the table as you want." She's set herself up very comfortably in the kitchen. 

Actually where did she find tape to build some of her set? Marissa never lends out that tape...she got both Marissa and Jillian to go along with this...how? Why?

"So, the twist is: every dollar more than I start with is an hour you have to be a girl for. Say I end up at eleven am with twenty three bucks? You have to be Amity until midnight tonight. I'm sure even with my meager winnings I can buy you something to wear...say...a maid outfit."

This utter minx. 

How can she be so sexy and cool all at once? It's the bra. The peek of her bra strap through the bottom of the arm holes of her shirt are redefining everything I thought I knew about her chest. I'm pretty sure I've seen Gavin shirtless briefly when he took of a jumper last winter. But I'm unable to shake the mental image that Grace has a very small pair of breasts somehow. 

Okay, let's not think about Grace naked. Let's think about something else.

"So you're betting on beating me at a purely luck based game and I'll fall for the gambler's fallacy to end up losing any substantial amount of money?" No. That's clear. Her wicked smile that makes my heart pound says otherwise. But I don't see how this could go any other way.

She's got the table in the kitchen set up like a poker table with some green fabric I didn't know we had taped to the top for effect. Laid out on both sides is about twenty bucks in small change. Like, yeah I could get stuck, but how do the blinds work?

"How do the blinds work? That's normally how casinos get you to actually lose money. Without those I'd never bet on hands I didn't think could win and it'd be too easy to play it safe." There's that same smile again. Is she planning to cheat? No. Everything I know about Grace says she wants to win honestly. But I don't see how I can lose much of anything. "Okay, so what's the restriction? There's gotta be a catch."

"If you sit down to play you gotta stay the whole hour and what I have at the end of that is calculated as time with dollars to hours and you stick to it."

I don't see anything detrimental. And I've not really got anything planned for this morning. I can have breakfast while we play too.

"Sure. It's a bet."

She looks so sexy right now, the confidence radiating off her is unfathomable.

I sit down and start pouring myself a bowl of cereal. Grace shuffles the cards and deals both her and myself a pair of cards. 

A pair of twos. Not an amazing hand, but it's worth seeing what the common cards are before folding.

"Check."

"Check." Grace didn't even look at her cards, she is looking at her phone though...that's suspicious.

She flips over the first three common cards and it's a three a four and an eight. That's a nothing burger if I ever saw one.

As I think about how to count to five the door opens and Aaron and Blake come in. I check my own phone for the time and they're right on time: ten AM. 

...Was that the reason Grace checked her phone?

"Great, now for phase two." Grace pulls a piece of paper that by the sounds of it was taped to the bottom of the table and slaps it on the side facing Aaron and Blake. I can't see it from here I'm sitting but I can see them reading it silently. They don't seem to recognise Grace, but Blake didn't meet Gavin or Grace and Aaron has forgotten how own name before, so this isn't the real test.

They start muttering quietly among the pair of them. I can only assume Grace wrote a request for quiet on her sign.

Or that would be the case of Aaron and Blake didn't back out of the apartment and leave again with a weird look on their faces.

"Check." Grace's voice brings me back to the game at hand.

"Check." I respond, still unsure what's going on.

The next card is a nine. Everything is odd suits so not even a flush is possible.

"Twenty cents." A pair is worth a small bet.

"Call." I could get used to this game, I like listening to Grace's voice. The smile that's impossible to hide from her voice just does things to me I would never tell anyone else about.

Grace flips the river.

Another nine. So I'm looking at two pair eight high. Pretty much any card on the board beats me. A pair of twos is kinda a terrible hand to keep. But I kept it more to watch Grace and see if she had any obvious tells. And aside from smiling the whole time, I have no idea how I can't win.

"So what do I get if I'm ahead?"

"Is drawing attention away from me not prize enough? I thought we were on a team here."

"If you want me to fall for the gambler's fallacy I would think I need something worth foolishly chasing, otherwise I'd just never bet and fold every hand."

"Dealer's choice. You can ask any favor of me you want." Don't say that. All I can think about would be to ask for another... "Like even a a second kiss."

She knows.

How does she know? I've been so well behaved since Friday. 

"Ohh, looks like you win this hand." She has to know, she has to be playing me.

### 10:58am Friday - Amity

SHE PLAYED ME LIKE A FIDDLE!!

This wasn't ever a bet. This was a riddle!! And she got me with my over confidence. Luck based game my left nut, this was a setup.

I tore the piece of paper off the side of the table and read it aloud.

"Hi I'm Grace. David here thinks he's being very clever, but he's agreed that for every dollar I have after eleven am (minus ten dollars) will get translated to hours and that's how long he has to crossdress and go by she/her pronouns and the name Amity (I think it suits her). So if you can run out to the nearest ATM and pull out a few hundred dollars to lend me until eleven it will be the funniest prank to pull on 'David' and be probably worth a few course credits for his Feminism class he said he was taking." These bozos have fucking cavhorted against me.

Grace leaned over and pointed to some more text along the bottom.

"P.S the closer you return to just before eleven am so David doesn't work out what the trick is, the better."

This is next level.

She fucking forcefemmed me. She convinced all our friends that as a fun Sunday prank, before I make them a nice home cooked meal, that they'd tally up...

"FOUR THOUSAND AND TWENTY NINE DOLLARS?!" I'm gonna be a girl forever. I mean, I did want that, but not like this. 

"That's a hundred and sixty seven and a half days." Grace has the biggest shit eating grin on her face. If I wasn't surrounded by other guys I'd be so turned on right now. "About five and a half months. It's a little more than I expected, but good job team. This'll knock the wind out of David's sails for a hot minute."
