# Out of the Frying Pan and Into the Other Frying Pan I Guess

### 10:27am Monday - Gavin

"I can get the money."

"Do you know how many kids say that and just stuff me with the bill? No. I'm being generous just giving you the week to clear out."

"Do I get my deposit back?"

"After delinquent rent and the costs to clean the apartment, I doubt there'd be more than fifty bucks left over. Make plans and scram, Kid."

The first time I meet my landlord is when he's kicking me out. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do after this.

### 10:27am Saturday - Grace

"You can have my car or something."

"Grace. No. I don't want your money. If you don't want the ongoing costs of a car feel free to sell it. But I'm not going to keep you in poverty, your money is yours. You were essentially homeless yesterday, you deserve a chance to get back on your feet."
