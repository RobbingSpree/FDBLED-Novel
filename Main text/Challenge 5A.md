# Out of the Frying Pan and Into the Other Frying Pan I Guess

### 10:27am Monday - Gavin

"I can get the money."

"Do you know how many kids say that and just stiff me with the bill? No. I'm being generous just giving you the week to clear out."

"Do I get my deposit back?"

"After delinquent rent and the costs to clean the apartment, I doubt there'd be more than fifty bucks left over. Make plans and scram, Kid." That sounds like a lie, but how do I even prove that? 

The first time I meet my landlord is when he's kicking me out. How does anyone else deal with this stuff?

### 10:27am Saturday - Grace

"You can have my car or something."

"Grace. No. I don't want your money. If you don't want the ongoing costs of a car: feel free to sell it. But I'm not going to keep you in poverty, your money is yours. You were essentially homeless yesterday, you deserve a chance to get back on your feet."

No one is allowed to cry. Least of all me.

Wait...ladies ARE allowed to cry...and I NEED to act like a believable lady...

...can't cry on command though and the moment has passed. I'll cry next time, for sure.

I didn't realise how used to seeing Amity I was until this morning. I fully expected the same skater chick is been taunting and teasing the last few weeks to open the door. The same lady I left here last night. But no. It was David. He looks so alien now, and awkward. Why did he looks so much more vibrant and excited when being forced to dress like a girl? Is it a little of that anonymity letting him act without his past or other's preconceptions weighing him down.

Should I keep making him dress like a girl then?

He sure didn't seem to hate being in make up last night (I never saw him rub at it and it was flawless until...), and the look suits him. He'd probably thank me in the long run. Yeah, just like I accidentally told everyone I was moving away forever today and instead stayed right where I was and took on a disguise, maybe I can give David the same kind of fool proof excuse.

"You need help bringing the rest of your stuff in?" 

"What stuff?" I have no idea how anyone fills an entire apartment. I first thought Flick's apartment came pre-furnished with several generations tat with how jam packed it was. "I got all my stuff." I turn and show off the two backpacks I managed to wear at once. It only works in one direction, one of them has really extendable arm straps and the other one is a normal bag. "See?"

"Your life fits into two bags?" David looks impressed.

"It can be less. I was in a bit of a rush this morning and didn't have time to sort through everything."

David turned and walked off muttering to themselves, but since I was expecting this after last night, it sounded like: "What gift do you give the girl who has nothing?" And that's silly, I don't want anything cause I've got everything I need.

I'm like the Buddha like that.

"Okay, well...follow me down here, I'll show you the room you'll be staying in." David lead me down the corridor I'd previously only gone down to use the toilet. We passed several doors, the only one open being what I assumed was David's room. The brief glance I saw inside gave me the same confusion I got from seeing Flick's entire apartment. Stuff was crammed everywhere and there were a lot of upright drawers. "This one." They announced stiffly, the bounce and virve they spoke with last night all but entirely missing.

David stood next to the only other open door in the corridor. This one I recognised, cause it was the one everyone mistook for the toilet when they first tried to follow the instructions David gave out. This door was the last one on the left side of the corridor (and the toilet was next to it in a weird diagonal corner that can be thought of as at the end and kinda not ON the left), and on the open door David had stuck a piece of paper that read:

"Graceful Sanctuary..? Now people really will think this is the toilet."

"What? No!"

"Just write 'Grace's Room' or something that says its purpose explicitly. Don't try to be a poet. We know so many people who won't understand the intent here. That's just asking for trouble. You're letting the jazz get in your brain." It's moments like this where I have no idea what the full arc of thought that lead to this moment for David is and I don't think asking questions could ever unravel it. 

What do they even think 'sanctuary' means?

Don't think about when she kissed you. That's not at all related to this. It's not that kind of sanctuary. I've just been reading too much period romance stories who all use the same style of flowery language.

"Fine. You get unpacked and I'll go grab the stuff I got you earlier." What did she just say about not know what to get a girl who had nothing?
