# Out of the Frying Pan and Into the Other Frying Pan I Guess

### 10:27am Monday - Gavin

"I can get the money."

"Do you know how many kids say that and just stiff me with the bill? No. I'm being generous just giving you the week to clear out."

"Do I get my deposit back?"

"After delinquent rent and the costs to clean the apartment, I doubt there'd be more than fifty bucks left over. Make plans and scram, Kid." That sounds like a lie, but how do I even prove that? 

The first time I meet my landlord is when he's kicking me out. How does anyone else deal with this stuff?

### 10:27am Saturday - Grace

"You can have my car or something."

"Grace. No. I don't want your money. If you don't want the ongoing costs of a car: feel free to sell it. But I'm not going to keep you in poverty, your money is yours. You were essentially homeless yesterday, you deserve a chance to get back on your feet."

No one is allowed to cry. Least of all me.

Wait...ladies ARE allowed to cry...and I NEED to act like a believable lady...

...can't cry on command though and the moment has passed. I'll cry next time, for sure.

I didn't realise how used to seeing Amity I was until this morning. I fully expected the same skater chick is been taunting and teasing the last few weeks to open the door. The same lady I left here last night. But no. It was David. He looks so alien now, and awkward. Why did he looks so much more vibrant and excited when being forced to dress like a girl? Is it a little of that anonymity letting him act without his past or other's preconceptions weighing him down.

Should I keep making him dress like a girl then?

He sure didn't seem to hate being in make up last night (I never saw him rub at it and it was flawless until...), and the look suits him. He'd probably thank me in the long run. Yeah, just like I accidentally told everyone I was moving away forever today and instead stayed right where I was and took on a disguise, maybe I can give David the same kind of fool proof excuse.

"You need help bringing the rest of your stuff in?" 

"What stuff?" I have no idea how anyone fills an entire apartment. I first thought Flick's apartment came pre-furnished with several generations tat with how jam packed it was. "I got all my stuff." I turn and show off the two backpacks I managed to wear at once. It only works in one direction, one of them has really extendable arm straps and the other one is a normal bag. "See?"

"Your life fits into two bags?" David looks impressed.

"It can be less. I was in a bit of a rush this morning and didn't have time to sort through everything."

David turned and walked off muttering to themselves, but since I was expecting this after last night, it sounded like: "What gift do you give the girl who has nothing?" And that's silly, I don't want anything cause I've got everything I need.

I'm like the Buddha like that.

"Okay, well...follow me down here, I'll show you the room you'll be staying in." David lead me down the corridor I'd previously only gone down to use the toilet. We passed several doors, the only one open being what I assumed was David's room. The brief glance I saw inside gave me the same confusion I got from seeing Flick's entire apartment. Stuff was crammed everywhere and there were a lot of upright drawers. "This one." They announced stiffly, the bounce and virve they spoke with last night all but entirely missing.

David stood next to the only other open door in the corridor. This one I recognised, cause it was the one everyone mistook for the toilet when they first tried to follow the instructions David gave out. This door was the last one on the left side of the corridor (and the toilet was next to it in a weird diagonal corner that can be thought of as at the end and kinda not ON the left), and on the open door David had stuck a piece of paper that read:

"Graceful Sanctuary..? Now people really will think this is the toilet."

"What? No!"

"Just write 'Grace's Room' or something that says its purpose explicitly. Don't try to be a poet. We know so many people who won't understand the intent here. That's just asking for trouble. You're letting the jazz get in your brain." It's moments like this where I have no idea what the full arc of thought that lead to this moment for David is and I don't think asking questions could ever unravel it. 

What do they even think 'sanctuary' means?

Don't think about when she kissed you. That's not at all related to this. It's not that kind of sanctuary. I've just been reading too much period romance stories who all use the same style of flowery language.

"Fine. You get unpacked and I'll go grab the stuff I got you earlier." What did she just say about not know what to get a girl who had nothing?

### 10:31am Saturday - ~~Amity~~ David

I don't know if this is a crush or if I feel like her mom. 

Like...who wants to spoil their friends and buy them clothes and nice things? Regardless, going out this morning and doing a quick run back down to the second hand shop was the right decision. I don't want to show off Grace walking down the street with David. I want to show her off as mine when I'm Amity. Not that she's mine. She's her own woman. Man...thing? Just gonna stick with woman, it's more important to not get confused and out her than be respectful about pronouns.

I don't know how to show her off on Amity's arm now though. With Grace living here also I won't have any reliable alone time to be Amity at home, let alone practice makeup. How am I supposed to explain that? Tell her the truth? She'll assume I'm some kind of sex pest making her do this. And I don't want to try and bait her into punishing me so I can crossdress. I don't want Grace to have a bad opinion of me cause I taunted her (and I still have to work off the bad reputation my choices last night saddled me with).

She was so soft and delicate in my hands though. I'm gonna have to find out what other girlfriends or boyfriends Grace has had to know if they're liable to come back and try to claim her again. 

Okay, banishing evil thoughts and returning to her side looking sane and normal.

Back in the storage room Grace has finished unpacking her everything. A digital clock, a laptop, a ratty looking blanket they're folding back up, some clothes and that's it. What was in the second bag? Scouring the room I don't see anything different. The only thing out of place is the floor chair that no one used that has been set out like a low quality mattress. Wait. Pillow. They dedicated a whole bag to their pillow. 

"Did you not own any manchester?"

"The city?" Don't be cute, Grace. 

"The bed sheets." Tell me you just threw them out cause they were as worn through as your shoes and you weren't sleeping on bare mattresses.

"Don't need one without a mattress." Grace. I will make you sleep on my bed and I'll take the couch at this rate. I thought those pictures of guy's apartments with no furniture and a bare mattress on the floor were just jokes people captured while moving in or out. Grace, you're showing how there's always someone more bizzare than you can imagine, thank you.

"Okay...well setting that aside for later." If I don't move on I will really turn into her mom and start doting on her. "Can you try on some of the clothes I brought you? You can't...won't...aren't allowed to only wear one outfit."

"I was thinking about that. I think some of my...as you called them: shame clothes."

"..." Biting my tongue! Biting my tongue! Biting my tongue! Don't make a joke. Don't say you can make her feel shame and like it. Don't. Keep it in. That's only something Amity is allowed to say. And even that's probably a step too far. Don't look at her lips! Bad girl! Boy...man...thing.

### 10:57am Saturday - ~~Amity~~ David

"See?" Go on, twirl. It's fun. Those shorts are baggy enough to almost be a skirt. "It looks fine."

"I don't know how to say this...but you look like a different person from the waist down." You really look like someone tore a barbie doll in half and stuck a random other doll's legs in its place.  "Those pants don't fit you. I didn't notice before cause it was uniform with how it hung on you. But you did kinda look like you wear a cloud, or a shadow." 

"It's just what I feel comfortable in. Stuff that's like a blanket, all safe and wrapped up." 

"I can't vibe with that. My clothes need to be respectable." Though, if I look at what I've been wearing as Amity...I might need to re-evaluate that idea. "But you have to admit, clothes that fit you can look good."

"That's not as wise as you think." Don't smile at me like that Grace...I NEED to not look at your lips and you're making that a lot harder than it could be. "Of course well fitting clothes look good, we've all seen runway models. We've been propagandized to like that." And you don't think it has something to do with you looking like one of those runway models that you look good?

"Setting aside the male gaze."

"What did they ever do to warrant being discarded." Grace, I mean it. Stop being cute. Or so help me I will go put on my emergency skirt that's still in the bag I bought it in and come back in here and kiss you again.

I can be calm. I can be normal. I'm not at all having improper thoughts about someone I'm giving shelter to.

"Setting aside how a lot of fashion is marketed under the assumption that it's only worth looking good to a male perspective. You were probably due for a wardrobe refresh. I doubt your sister would even recognise you without your trademark beanie let alone the rest of the stuff you're wearing."

"Good job remembering the course material, that almost sounded sensible. That does raise a question though: what do I do tomorrow? Just hide in here all day and eat leftovers when it's done?"

"What? No! You're as thin as a rake and I can smell how little you ate for breakfast, you're not missing any more meals."

"I told everyone I was leaving for good yesterday. Cause as far as I knew that's what I was doing. And now you've said I HAVE TO dress like this for room and board. I don't think everyone will assume I'm some new chick. They're not as thick as Aaron."

"Aaron has good opinions, he's a good egg."

I just have to think of something before tomorrow, it'll be fine.

### 6:48am Sunday - Amity

I have no ideas and have doomed Grace to ridicule and isolation.

This is a perfect idea and will solve everything!
