# Watching Her Closely
### Monday 6:49am - Amity

"David!!" I know that voice...why do I know that... "David! Wake up!!" Why are they choosing to be this wrong while I'm asleep?

"Amity."

"What?"

"That's what Grace changed my name to yesterday."

"Okay...AMITY get up and come look at how Grace sleeps."

I genuinely hate getting up early. There's nothing worth doing or seeing and my terrible sleep habits don't let me fall asleep early enough that I'm fully human by when Marissa and Jillian get up and start making noise.

Regardless, I force myself out of bed and plod after Marissa. She seems oddly excited and awake for this early, especially when she gets home so late from her job. Both Mar and Jillian work at the same pharmacy, and honestly I should see if I can get a job there too. My biochem degree should give me enough random pharmacy knowledge that I could work there. It would be a step up from my current job as dish hand in a terrible cafe.

Marissa leads me on the very short walk to Grace's Room where the door is already ajar. She stands next to the open door and gestures for me to look inside.

At first glance: there's no one in there. The floor chair I tried to lay out for Grace to use is still unoccupied but the pillow she brought is gone now. Instead as my eyes adjust and search the room I see her, curled up in the corner of the room, one the floor, with nothing but her blanket and pillow. She really does seem like a cat sometimes, but not one that wants to be touched or pet.

"Is that why you didn't get her a bed?"

"I found out she was homeless the night before she moved in. I didn't have any time to get anything ready. I thought she could use the floor seat. Maybe I need to save up some money and buy her something she'll actually use." Thankfully she's wearing yesterday's clothes, so Mar didn't see anything sensitive.

More importantly, maybe I needed to get someone in to fix this door if it opened on its own overnight or perhaps give it a lock.

### 3:48pm Monday - Amity

I didn't think about going to class at all. Why can't I think about the future?

I was so in love with the idea of being a girl, that I forgot one of the main reasons I had resisted doing anything like this until now. My class has a lot of people in it. People who's opinion on trans folks I don't know. People who have access to chemicals they could easily use to main or kill me with. Today's concerning chemical was an ampule of hydrofluro carbons (organic chemistry gets to use all the cool alchemist looking tools), a chemical that almost destroyed all life on earth if we had let it.

I tried dressing in the least attention grabbing outfit, but unlike the one Grace picked for me, I just looked very awkward in it. I don't know if she can ask whoever she had help her pick my first outfit for help again, but it looked so much better on me than this. Why is Grace better at making me look like Amity?

Do I need to just take Grace clothes shopping with me? She's seen me the most in clothes that look good on me...I'm not trying to get her to look at me more. I know she doesn't like me that way. I just appreciate her perspective, and want to look so hot she gets flustered again. These are very normal things to think about a friend/rival.

Unlike Grace though, I have to wear girl clothes everywhere, even on the walk home. I saw several people on that walk who were witness to my loss yesterday, I can't just stop now. If I committed this far and gave up now...I'd never heard the end of it or they might take more drastic measures. Like burning all my guy clothes...or printing out leaflets about my forced temporary transition...or keeping me on watch so I don't have a moment's peace. I have to stop reading forcefemme stories, none of those are feasible for something people took as a prank.

Walking back into the apartment something feels off...

...the kitchen isn't an utter bomb site. The entry area doesn't smell of mildew. And all the shoes aren't scattered like caltrops at the door. Has Grace been doing chores? Will she accept an allowance until she gets a new job? Will she think it's a joke if I buy her a maid dress to wear while doing chores? I can see her door open down the hall, making sure I'm not sneaking (in case the door has been opening on its own and she thinks it's closed) I approach and clear my throat.

"You in here, Grace?" Last thing I want to see right now is Grace while she's getting changed, which sounds contradictory when I keep imagining her undressing. But it's the authorial intent. If she's not trying to look sexy then it's not as appealing.

"Yeah, can you come give me a hand. This job apparently needs more than one person." Don't think sexy thoughts. Mind out of the gutter. It's not a sex thing. These pants are not robust enough to hide a full on erection.

I round the door frame and see Grace has arranged a corner of the room (not the corner she sleeps in I might add) to be a sort of photography studio. And trying to strike a paint-me-like-a-french-girl pose is Grace, laying in front of what I can only assume is a camera. It doesn't look like one (It's all wires and scaffolding and I can't tell where the lens is), but the rest of the setup and Grace's pose gives very few options for what it could be.

"I made a sort of digital camera from old laptop parts. The tripod is made from laptop frames and hinges." She sounds incredibly proud of what looks like a fire hazard with cables running every which way and all of them eventually connecting to her laptop sitting on the floor. 

"I have...several questions. All of them cannot be said on TV." Does she have some kind of sugardaddy already? I told her to be a girl not two days ago. How does she moved this fast? "Besides starting a fire, what's going on?"

"So you know how I'm broke."

"It somehow never fails to come up."

"Well without a job and still needing to pay for tuition, and it took me weeks to get my last job. So I'm trying something that might pay out quicker. Lonely Fans." Okay...so it was a sex thing. For once the ideas my dick came up with were correct, high five dick! Maybe I should listen to you more often, but could you lay down for a minute? I don't want Grace to spot you when her face is at dick height.

"I have...even more questions. But before I ask any of them, have you thought this through? Making porn is a bit of a jump." I have no idea how I feel on the topic cause I'm using all my mighty mental powers to not think about jerking it to sexy pictures of Grace.

"I don't see how this is much different to my last job." 

I have to talk to her about the depressing lore she keeps hinting at some day.

"Didn't you say your last job was moving boxes in a warehouse?" I don't (and refuse to) see how that's related to sex work.

"All labor is sex work if you think about it. If I'm wearing a uniform I don't like, selling my body and time and autonomy for a product, and faking an emotional display so the people benefiting from my efforts don't feel bad about my exploitation. How is it different from making porn?"

"I just think that I would have tried to get a different job before I jumped to porn."

"Have you seen the job market? What business is hiring in April? And I need to get paid ASAP."

"That reminds me...you're currently living rent free and not paying for groceries...what expenses are still haunting you?"
