# Because we help friends

### 7:09pm Friday - Gavin

"Amity." She looks like she's having the worst time possible. 

He. That's a guy. 

That's also a guy. Did Amity lose a bet to this thundering prat? Who does their best impression of a false gargoyle when trying to hit on girls? Or is he trying to talk over the opening solo of this jazz?

It doesn't mean anything that I saw half of Amity's face from across the room and called out that name and not David. My friend is in trouble I'd not be a good friend of I saw them clearly trapped and didn't do something to help. Especially when they're looking this panicked.

Whoever Amity lost a bet to this time really cares about appearances, cause they look amazing. The casual look we've been dunking one another in pales in comparison to the effort here. 

I'm kinda jealous. 

Why do the straight men cosplaying as trans girls get more support than someone like me? Or is this part of the whole women are seen as lesser thing so the more women Amity is made to look like the worse of a punishment it is?

I might also need to take Feminism 102 by remote next semester cause this clearly has depths I hadn't considered before.

Weaving through the crowd is fun, almost like a dance. The love of movement is still in my bones. I don't know if I still need to hide who I am. But you only need to get bullied to suicide once to hide something girly like dance forever.

I don't know if Amity heard me the first time. Especially with that wall of a guy looming over her. 

"Amity." Okay, yeah. She heard me that time. Don't give me that look, Flick pointed this guy out as someone to avoid, there's probably nothing that'll get him off your case.

"Hey, Amity. I've been looking for you all over, we must have gotten separated in the crowd." I'm not gonna expose you to this guy, don't worry. Did you get yourself that drink? It's not a cider, so no. Don't drink it. Give it to me. Don't make me carry you home. If you pass out from date rape, someone has to carry you home and I'm not telling Aaron to carry a seemingly random lady to your house. I'm projecting my thoughts directly into your mind: I'm going to spill it cause there's nowhere to put it down, don't be mad. Please, don't be mad. "Ohh, and you got me a drink, thanks." Let go of the drink, you fool.

Wow. That's a serious death glare. Yeah, I know it's probably emasculating to get rescued, but this isn't the kind of guy you can talk your way out of an encounter with. Please be chill. If we play this right he'll cut his losses and go if we just give him a hurdle he can't surmount.

"Hey..." Fuck, I forgot he was so close. How was Aimty putting up with his breath? I've been a little tunnel visioned on Amity the whole time I didn't realize I'd been getting close to both of them. "...my friend and I were having a chat here. Why don't you jog on, Stick?" Does he not know Amity's name? Did...did Amity give out another name? I thought really hard about that name. Or is he just so focused on his pickup artist script he forgot her name. I'm gonna guess the second, I doubt Amity's even been giving out any names tonight, much easier to no get embarrassed when there's no traces. So should I keep using Amity or also swap to 'friend'? 

Ohh?! 

Opportunity strikes! He's gonna push me. Great, let's use this to spill the drink and get Amity a little damp so we have double the reasons to leave. Just a little, so it's visible but will dry in no time in a room as warm as this one. One thing you can count on with enough people in a room: it's toasty in here.

"Oops." Sorry again, Amity.

Actually speaking of hot...what are you wearing Amity? Where did you get the shirt from? And why do your fake boobs look so much better tonight? I can't believe you sought to improve perfection. I had been using all those pads for years (I can't exactly ask for them back). I am a little curious what she's using instead. 

He! What he's using. 

Enough! 

I'm not cross-dressing anymore. I said I was done and I am. It's clearly not for me. Evident by Amity being a bombshell and my being a Stick.

"Well now we're short a drink, let's go grab a fresh one from the wheel of goon." I'm done, we're done, let's be done. I'll start packing up and getting ready to move our and leave forever tomorrow, so this can be a final nice thing I do for you, Amity. Don't give me that look, you are such a fucking outspoken proselytizer of cider I'm not going to mention that. You're the reason they've got cider here tonight. I'm not gonna dox you when we're half way through extracting you. Remember what you're wearing, you dork.

"Hey! Fuck off." Drat, I was hoping to get off scot-free. "I said my friend and I were having a chat, can't you see you're upsetting her?" I know I'm upsetting her, I bad mouthed cider by omission. She's being a champ not mentioning it now, I know I'm in for an earful about it later. 

Time to end this (and his ego probably).

"Amity, what say we make a bet? I can see how appreciative you've been of this guy's company..." Just gonna sneak closer so I can put myself between Brick-lad here and you, Amity. I don't trust he's not gonna try getting violent. I know you're not a girl, and I'm technically not a guy, but we gotta play the parts we're currently cast as. "...If I can get more attention from her than you've given him we leave together?"

Amity? You paying attention? Or is this now just boring? Three dudes in a huddle not doing it for you? Is the jazz not adding enough zest to the sausage salad? Come on! I need you to actually sell this otherwise this guy might hound you all night.

"Oi! Hands off my girl." Don't call David a girl, dude. It sounds so much weirder when someone else says it. Flick I can allow, she'll try to flirt with a girl's shadow. But this guy is somehow a step too far. 

"I can make my own choices." And tuning back in from jazz central is Amity. 

Okay, now we go for the kill. 

Double kills are fine too.

"The make-up looks good on you. Can I have a kiss to win this bet?" Just a quick chaste little peck is all it'll take. You get me? She gets me.

She got me. 

That's my face, Amity! Why did you grab my face! I need my face to look smug. Smugness is how we kill him.

She's so close. Let me go! What are you doing? 

Uaahhhhgg...This feels like too much, no one can like this. 

Amity, no. Please no. 

My heart feels like it's going to break.
