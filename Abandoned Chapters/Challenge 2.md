Challenge 2A - Unable to Resist

6:01pm Friday - Gavin

How did it come to premeditated vengeance against a friend?

I don't even know if I can call them a friend anymore…who plans revenge against their friends? But they did me a huge favour last week, even if I wanted to flee the whole time.

I don't know if last week and this week are going to be alike, but I have no intention of losing after throwing the gauntlet (regardless of how much I enjoy being my femme-sona), today is all about getting revenge for being made to walk home in that outfit last week…which reminds me: I forgot to grab the clothes I left at David's place on Sunday and Lance didn't drop them off during the week…I hope they haven't been misplaced and ended up in David or one of their roommate's washing.

Thinking of David's apartment, it seems I'm being haunted by jazz now cause the pool hall is playing some over the PA…or at least they were until a minute ago, I just saw one of the staff swap out a CD of all things. You can tell it's a good pool hall if the media system is unchanged from the 80's or 90's.

Regardless, today is about revenge. Revenge for having to face the whirlwind of emotions that came with walking home in that dress and feeling all those gazes on me. I was in no way mentally prepared to come out to anyone as trans, let alone walk about dressed like I did, there's an order to these things. It doesn't matter how nice it felt or how much I've been daydreaming about it happening again, who forces that on their friends?

And thus…I am entirely justified in my actions.

Assuming he turns up.

He has to turn up.

Why hasn't he turned up yet?

The whole first bet came about because of my prowess as a competitor that our whole friend group is trying to unseat. David isn't the kind of man to only dip their feet in and retire champion at first blush, especially if it's tied to the perception of a a lucky break.

If they balk and don't turn up I'm gonna bully them for…

"You ARE down here." I know that voice.

Turning to look up the escalator I'm sitting next to the bottom of, I can see them standing stark against the daylight of the street above as they slide closer on the automatic stairs. My rival, my fated foe, the person who's gonna get utterly finessed until they admit they were wrong to force me to dress like a girl before I was ready.

David looks incredibly smug for someone who's late.

"I've been looking for you on the street for the last ten minutes. Have you been down here the whole time?" My watch says I've been down here twenty minutes. I pull out my brick of a phone and check our messages. I did say to meet at the pool hall on George Street…let's ignore the ambiguity there and move on.

"Are you ready to suffer?" I kick one of the plastic shopping bags at my feet at him. The bag hits him with a solid thud. The confusion on his face was so worth spending hours trying to come up with a plan. "Can you pay for a table and we'll get ready to ruin your day."

"Hang on!" I was hoping he would let that slide. "You still owe me for the outfit from last time. I've got the IOU. You want me to spend more money while you're already in debt to me?" That's a bit of a slant, everyone knows I'm dead broke. Did he think we were coming here to watch someone else have a game?

I try to give them a look, how do you even tell someone they're not even first in line for a debt repayment if I did come into money?

"And do you just carry IOU's for various amounts on you at all time? Cause I don't have a pen this colour anywhere near my front door" Ohh, does David not know the system?

"You got a green one, right?" I had explained this so many times, in was surprised it hadn't been to David yet. "I've got a bunch of IOUs written up and when I get paid at the bend of the month is when I buy them back off people for their face value."

"Huh…" I could see the gears turning in his head, this dork is going to ask the same question everyone asks when they find out how this works. "So when am I going to get paid back at this rate?" Bingo!

"If I have money let over after a month when I get paid, and I've not been catastrophically underpaid, two Sunday dinners from now."

"Is that what you've doing…I thought you were buying drugs."

"With what money would I buy drugs?"

"I thought that was why you had no money, you'd unwisely spent it on drugs." This piece of work…he thinks I'm as capable as I am while also doing all the recreational drugs and being fiscally irresponsible? The nerve of him. Just for that I'm gonna destroy him from the first game.

"Regardless, can you pay for the game? They also need photo ID and I don't have any."

"They don't take uni IDs?"

"They do…I…lost mine." If David was a real man he'd pick up on that subtle hint and not ask what I think he's about to.

"And you get along without it? How? I need my ID to get everywhere on campus."

"I bought a cheap card with a mag strip and NFC chip and encoded the info on there. It's just a pretty normal two way hash. I only had to scan like three other…you don't need to known the specifics. Anyway, twenty cents for a replacement badge is way cheaper than what the uni is asking for. I just…don't get to use it as photo ID."

"Okay, all I understood is if I lose mine I'm getting a replacement from you." David kept up the conversation while paying for the game and handing over his driver's license. "What's the cost?"

"You've gotta void an IOU. There's no point paying me money in just gonna pay you right back."

"Fair enough." We grab cues and the plate of balls and head out into the dimly lit hall for our empty table.

A few tense moments of silence fall over the pool hall. Somehow everyone is lining up for a shot at once and with the music off: the whole space is quiet.

David is giving me a weird look with their "punishment" securely tucked under their arm in its bag. They might have guessed what's in store. The lights, barely overhead, cast an eerey light over everyone and the carpet eats all noise of our footsteps and making everything feels dreamlike and surreal.

Someone finally breaks the silence, the crash of ball on balls and balls against the bumpers and our moment of dramatically staring each other down is broken.

"So…" David starts setting up the table for a game and coincidentally the jazz starts up again. "What's the stakes? There's obviously stakes." They give their bag of punishment a shake and dropped it under the table.

"Like last time, we're playing until someone loses. Whoever loses…" I try to hold the tension for a moment, I can see the answer on David's lips already. "Has to change into the clothes provided and continue playing like that. None of this: one and done nonsense. Whoever wins changes back." Last time was too vague, this forces the game to continue, let's people play from a position of debt.

"Okay, I'm game. I can only see this going my way." David finished racking the balls and walks over to me. I had just been lazing and watching David busy themselves, I found myself entirely on the back foot. "Rock Paper Scissors for who goes first? I'll throw rock."

Already trying to get in my head, eh?

I took them at their word and threw paper.

Surprisingly David kept his word and threw rock, I win.

"I'll give you a chance to start this off and go second."

This'll let me see how good he actually is at this game, so I know what I can get away with.

David lined themselves up, cue balanced on their hand between their thumb and pointer and struck well. The sound of a ball being sunk piped up amungst the noises of the hall. A quick scan showed it was one of the bigs. So we're off to a good start then, they know (or are lucky enough to fluke) how to start a game, let's see what his follow up shot is.

Miss. He missed almost everything and lazed the cue ball to the same end of the table it started at.

There aren't any clear shots to a small ball, so I couldn't be sure he missed on purpose. But, provided I hit one of my balls first I would get two shots in a row to set up and get a payoff.

Looking at the table though…there was something a little more evil I could do.

Friday 6:12pm - David

I know a few things about pool. How to play, how to win, and how to lose. And kinda not much else. But I did know that for someone of my skill, knocking the balls around like a fool wouldn't exactly help me, since I was no good at adding spin the to cue ball to stop it helping Gavin. So it was better to just scratch and put the cue ball somewhere unhelpful and make the problem something for Gavin to puzzle out.

I couldn't really work out what ball he was aiming for however.

His focused gaze was on the middle of the table, but there wasn't much else there for him. Sure there was one of my balls, but also the black ball. And that was one of the few things I knew. Sinking it early would lose me the game.

Last week, I had wanted to lose, but that was in the privacy of my own house and in the privacy of my own plan. This was in public. We had walked in here. We had started playing at this table. Surely other players would have seen us and would notice if one of the players left and came back in different clothes.

If Gavin had given me something daring to wear…I don't know if I would be able to come back out after changing.

And he hadn't mentioned it, but I assumed there was a penalty for multiple loses in a row. Or for refusing the outfit.

Gavin struck the cue ball, I hadn't even paid any attention to his form, was he any good? Did he knowhow to hold the cue?

The cue ball avoided every other ball and bounced off the far bumper and came to rest exactly where he'd been looking.

The cue ball was now wedged between, the center pocket, the black ball, the red big ball. If I was any good I could get a clean shot and knock the Red into the corner pocket from here. But I didn't think I was that good, and I might knock the black one into the opposite center pocket.

This was clearly their plan. They'd yielded their extra penalty shot to snooker me.

If I took a shot in pretty much any other direction or hit the black ball first and yield another penalty shot, this time in a much more playable part of the table.

"…fuck…" I tried to keep that to myself, but I could hear Gavin smiling, I could hear the wail of jazz cheering for his victory. I couldn't look at them. I'd lose my nerve.

I lined up the shot for the red to corner pocket, pulled back a reasonable amount. And fired. A solid powerful shot. The red ball rocketed into the corner pocket and stayed there, sinking in and advancing me to two ahead. The cue ball once again ended up in the starting circle, and the black ball bounced harmlessly off the opposite wall.

I was safe.

I started walking around to the other side, giving up the best spots to aim the next shot from.

A terrible sound.

Gavin was squeaking.

A look of unadulterated joy on his face.

I glanced back at the table.

The black ball wasn't finished moving.

Slowly, but with clearly more than enough energy to make it. It was rolling back to where it had started the turn. Except this time the cue ball wasn't in the way.

I wasn't ready for this.

Painfully slowly it rolled to the edge of the pocket.

I could always beat myself to death with the cue…right? I had time.

And it fell in.

Gavin flashed me a smile I'd only seen Grace wear.

Yeah, I don't know if we can be friends while he's being my rival.

"Well played…so what you expecting a strip show?" This was the worst, I knew I could dress Gavin to look good (or at least passable for a cis guy's sensibilities) cause he had the best kind of body to dress, but Gavin looked like he dressed himself of a morning by crawling backwards through a bush all his clothes we're trapped in. I was expecting some terrible party city costume, a warped idea of what women wore. Nothing about his attitude to dressing himself gave me any confidence he'd spend any attention on dressing me.

"There's a unisex bathroom out the back" He pointed to the back of the hall where a small spotlight highlighted an exit to a side hallway. I was beginning to think he held a grudge about last week.

Snatching my bag of mystery back off the floor I slinked away to change.

Friday 6:15pm - Gavin

This was the best. I could see why David had wanted to play with these stakes. Seeing someone else panic and stress as they realized the new reality this entails.

I might even have to apologize to David after this, cause he does seem to be hating this (not much of a feminist to act like dressing like a woman is such a terrible thing). I don't see why he thinks that, he gave me a really good outfit last week. Why would I do anything less than find something that looks good on him? I think I did such a good job that I might awaken something in him.

It's so much easier to find clothes for other people than myself. I don't think I even know what I look like anymore I've been avoiding looking at my own reflection for that long. I spent so much of this week at home in that cardigan (I couldn't wear the dress with how many people drop by unannounced) and I still couldn't work out why it looked so good on me.

Finding a style to suit David wasn't hard, I just went and sat in one of the uni cafés (with a free cup of water in a fancy mug, they insisted I not look like too much of a charity case while I took up space) and watched all the girls go past and just took notes on the ones with a similar body shape to David.

I started re-racking the game, making sure to keep an eye on spotlight entry so I could see their entrance or if they tried to make a break for the stairs and leave.

Friday 6:17pm - David

I have no words and screaming is not advisable. If I scream someone will hear and will try to help, and what do I say then?

"Sorry I was afraid of some clothes I lost a bet and have to wear?" Then I'd be worse than a pervert…I'd be a coward.

How bad can it be? It's just clothes. Well…it's not JUST clothes. It's also facing the reality I look bad in them. That I look like a mockery of a woman. That all I can amount to being is a fantasy wrapped in a disappointment.

I'm just been sitting here, not even opening the bag, dreading what's in there.

Gavin might even come by and check on me…

That would honestly be worse. I can't have them seeing me like this. Losing at pool cause I got snookered is one thing, losing all my dignity cause I can't even look at an outfit Gavin put together would be worse than death.

Damn, I hope it at least fits.

I tear the bag open and the clothes inside burst out and scatter on the floor.

I have no words…what am I even looking at?

---

6:30pm Friday - Gavin

I have no words…did they find a back exit I didn't know about?

They've been in there for a while now. And I've seen other people go in and come back since.

I mean…I did put a pair of tights in there, tights can be hard to put on for a guy. But everything else is normal clothes and a well filled sports bra.

That was my criticism for David's idea of ladies fashion: he was too high minded and conceptual. Not putting a padded bra in is a design failure. Like not or not, breasts are a key part of women's fashion, something about patriarchal forces and such…the YouTube essays I've been listening to haven't got to the bit where they explain exactly what that is yet…but I'm not going to say no to some T&A.

"Speaking of T&A…there's some now!."

David has finally returned, and he's wearing the tights (and the rest of the outfit).

I guess I made a mistake or two.

The shirt I got him is way shorter than I expected. What was supposed to show a peek of tummy is entirely midriff bearing. And those shorts, I really thought they would cover a lot more of his legs; the tights were a really good back-up plan, cause I do not know how comfortable he would be in such short shorts without another layer that covers his skin. And he's wearing the outer layer correctly even, I pulled off all the buttons so there'd only be one way to wear it.

I had seen a few women wear almost this exact outfit on campus and they looked good in it. David is wearing it surprisingly well. I mean…I did pick it specifically for his box like body and long legs. But I was sure his head would stick out with his close cropped hair, but he just looks like a sexy lesbian.

Fuck…

I do think he looks sexy.

I've made a monster.

I'm pretty sure he even put on the sports bra. I jammed that thing with every pad I could get my hands on, it looks really good.

I can't tell if he's embarrassed with the low lighting here. But he's taking shakey steps back to the table.

"Took you long enough…wait…where's your old clothes?"

Ohh. Ohh! Yeah!!!

He's so fucking embarrassed!!

YEAH!!!

WORTH IT!

I can see the blush now that he's back under the table light. And it makes him look adorable. I've made an adorable monster.

"While I was finishing getting dressed, I had put my other clothes on the basin…" This is the best, I need to torment him more. I'm gonna get addicted to this. I'm gonna need to make new friends specifically for teasing and bullying cause this is the best.

"Go on…"

"Someone burst in and threw up in the sink and got it all over my dude-clothes." Serves you right, ya tosspot! Make me walk home in that getup and see where it gets ya!!

"Ready for game two then?" No time for crying over spilled milk, or spilled bodily fluids, time to press my advantage.

---

6:45pm Friday - Grace

Okay…so I guess my advantage really evaporated when David lost the ability to change back into "dude-clothes". All he really needed was any game where he had a good start and I couldn't catch up enough.

So now I'm dressed as Grace again, as David won't stop mentioning it.

"Go on, Grace. It's your shot."

I don't want to validate that with a response, but it is doing things to me whenever he calls me by a girl's name.

I didn't think I would be this affected.

Last week…last week I was fine after I changed outfits…I could still play darts like it was nothing.

Do I need to be called cute? Is that was gave me back my mojo back then? Why didn't I dress up in this outfit more since then? I had a chance to acclimatise and become immune to the feeling of this dress on my legs and I wasted the week just wearing the cardigan.

"I don't have all day, Grace."

I can't look at him when he's like this…cause I do not have the crotch reinforcement that pants give and I will embarrass myself if he knows what his outfit does to me.

How do I turn this around? I don't really need to play better, I can take a leaf from David's book and just make him play worse.

"Actually, David…since you've not really got a penalty for losing anymore…" When I went in the toilet to change I saw his vomit covered clothes in the trash, he wasn't making that part up. "I think you need some stakes to play for…let's say that since you seem so keen to call me Grace dressed like this…"

"Hey, you picked that name, I'm just following your lead."

"Exactly, if I win you follow me lead and I pick a name you go by while wearing this." Yeah! That had a reaction, his face is deadly pale and I can see him sweating already. Now I just need to think what name suits him.

Ohh well, I've got a whole game to think it over.

---

6:47pm Friday Grace

Ohh, wow.

That had way more of an impact than I thought.

I feel kinda bad about this.

They are losing their mind over this.

I think this might have been the easiest game of pool I ever played. I swear some of their shots did nothing but help me out, how shaken up does this make them? Ohh well, time to end this and push the knife in.

"Corner pocket." And in goes the eight ball. "And that's game…want to guess the name I've thought up for you?"

David looks haggard. I don't know which is worse for him, losing this badly, or not knowing what awaited him at the end.

A frail nod, that's all they've got left.

I actually didn't have much time to go on, so I'm just gonna go with my first idea. First ideas are normally the correct ones, even if they need a little sharpening with time.

"All right, I dub thee…"

---

6:46pm Friday - ???

At this point it's impossible to win.

Grace is three balls ahead, I can't stop shaking, and I think…I want to lose again…

If anything, cause she named new terms for this bet I can stop her from changing back when she wins. But I think this is where call it.

I have been vibrating with enthusiasm the whole time. I haven't had a chance to look at myself in a mirror yet, but my shadow looks good and the guys on the next table might have been checking me out. I don't know if I hate that or not. But Grace for sure, has been checking me out.

I don't know what her plans were for this, but the fact she put a well padded sports bra in the kit, means she's got that on her mind.

Actually, if she's given me a disguise that already has a bust included, if I start taking HRT I can always remove pads as the girls grow so it always looks the same.
