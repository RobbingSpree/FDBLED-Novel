Characters:

David/Amity, 19, bio-chem student

The fool who first springs the idea when bored with their friend Gavin

Short, stocky, has been teased for being unmanly for being short and had a friend get bullied to a failed suicide attempt for expressing a desire to be trans in high school. 19, in second year of uni. Short hair (short on sides, longer on top) (that they've kept short with the intention of buying and wearing wigs but hasn't had the confidence yet due to dysphoria), well built arms from part time laborer job, same with their thighs. Reasonable hand eye coordination, poor memory for names remembers nicknames they give people easier. Considers themselves a good host above all else

Nervous and cautious when a guy, confident and generous when a girl

Skin tone: tanned, no freckles

Hair texture/colour:

Voice: casual and slang when thinking

Fashion: suits gyaru and skater chick fashion

First outfit: short, tight jeans. Loose grey tartan button up shirt with no buttons. Black crop top. Sports bra jammed full of pads. Black tights.

How treats the other (and wants to be treated in turn): acts like Grace and Gavin are different people. Feels their own history and position in their friend group casts a deep shadow that they can't escape even if they did get received well if they came out.

Reason not out as trans: wants to call themselves a woman and has been looking for all sorts of signs that will let them say they have crossed that barrier and become a woman. But they keep seeing it as a temporary incursion that they fall back from, essentially having a fem version of themselves and a bloke version. Kinda bi gender, very much trying to twist bioessentialist traits to support their ego.

Gavin/Grace, 19, comp sci student

A lanky human who feels ill at ease with their body and wishes someone would force fem them as they don't have the courage nor the confidence that they would look any good. When David challenges them to the first contest is far too nervous to hit the target in their panic of being found out by a friend.

Tall and thin due to genetics and terrible eating habits, never eats well and their anxiety constantly kills their appetite. They did dance for several years as a child but was bullied out of it due to toxic masculinity defining everything slightly effeminate, but they've been generally coordinated since then and played basketball as a teen for a few years before the uniforms became a bit too dysphoric. They have a quiet and higher pitched voice and might actually be intersex and don't speak much due to not feeling safe to do so.

Cat coded and relaxed when a guy, higher energy and michevious when a girl, very depressed and low energy a lot of the time, jumps to self harm when stressed

Voice: poetic and casual, michevious when presenting femme

Fashion: suits elegant long skirts and long cardigans

First outfit: loose A-line dress. Calf length cardigan

How treats the other (and wants to be treated in turn): cool and flexible and mysterious, each moment and action redefines them. Wants others to be quick to redefine them easily and without much comment.

Reason not out as trans: sees themselves as a fake woman. With the addition of their disguise (while convincing) it doesn't change who they are underneath. Has very intense body dismophia, struggles to bathe due to needing to get naked. They feel they are fooling everyone else and themselves when they crossdress. Bought into the terf idea that gender isn't something that can be changed and sees their cross-dressing and fantasies as calming a desire for living a different, easier, life.

Aaron, 18, Art Major

Built like a brick shithouse, soft and cuddly, but can't pick up the social cues laid out for him and often grabs subtle stuff or things people want to ignore.

Felicity, 20, Art Major in Photography

A downstairs neighbour to Gavin, had her sights on Gavin as a potential egg but when Gav came to her with what sounded like another egg they could both jointly forcefem she was on board

Challenges:

1: Darts - Gavin loses

Chat: make things seem fine, Gavin throws gauntlet

2: Pool - David loses, Gavin also loses, David has no way to change back at the end to get their licence back and has to out themselves

Chat: David doesn't think walking home in girl clothes is that serious and baits a first one to flinch loses bet while walking the mall challenge from Gavin

Chat2: Flik asks Gavin about the trans girl the clothes were for and if they're as cute as planned?

3: Window Shopping - Gavin somehow ruins an expensive garment while they're trying it on and David is forced to cover the cost, Gavin now seriously owes David money. Flik turns up and meets David and aggressively flirts with them.

4: David mentions one of the rooms in their apartment is up for subletting and it would save on travel and food costs for Gavin so they can pay David back, on the condition Gavin dresses femme 24/7 and adopts their femsoma as who's living there

Chat: Flik reaches out to Aaron to ask more about the trans girl Gavin knows who refuses to deadname a trans person but also doesn't know if Grace is the person Flik is asking about or if Grace made a friend

5: Gavin wants to turn the tables and bets they can win big at blackjack and says for each $10 above what they started at David has to wear their fem clothes only for a day per. Borrows a bunch of money from their friends when they come by as it wasn't stated the money Gavin earned had to come from the game. Aaron is the first person they reach out to who helps under the provision they get their money back. Gavin agrees and has to admit to being Gavin to Aaron who acknowledges their own trans mom and brushes the idea of needing to stick to specific identities and names and he's fine with pretending he doesn't know anything about Grace so they can experiment with their identity.

Then status:

Living together, both permanently wearing fem clothes and adopting fem names, still very much want to continue cause it's a great excuse and they want to make the other pay for being kinda a bitch about it

Chapter 2 end dangling threads

David now inflicted with name Amity

David forced to walk home dressed as Amity and get into her house secretly

Gavin walked home dressed as Grace

Gavin forgot clothes at pool

Upon getting home Gavin was given that night to pack their things and get out due to being behind on rent

Gavin slept in their girl clothes

Chapter 3 deep notes

We join this challenge already in progress

Grace and Amity have been pressing each other to do more ladylike things for an hour

We join with them both on the precipice of a leigerie store

Amity is pressuring Grace to just have a look and MAYBE try a bra on, they're on the shelf so people try them on afterall

Grace is watching Felicity follow them from a distance sweating cause she forgot she would be dressed as Grace and can't work out what she's going to say to Flik later

Grace accepts if only to escape the gaze of Flik

Amity hands Grace a AAA bra with no support and suggest she try it on for fit

Struggle in changing room since to change a bra with a dress it requires getting essentially naked and Grace is dealing with a lot more dysphoria than she is used to experiencing and trying to dissuade Amity from coming in "you did sports, you must be used to being seen in change rooms this is nothing, I just want to make sure you're not just faking putting it on."

Shopkeep comes by asking if there's any issues and if Grace needs any help with sizing

Amity tries to press their advantage and gets the shopkeeps attention on them

Shopkeep instantly notices the heavily stacked sports bra and insists they take off the shirt and go into a change room

Grace comes back out (forgetting she's wearing the bra)
