I have so much to update you on
I don't care that you're asleep, I need to get this down before I forget
okay
so Grace sleeps on the floor
I kinda want to try to convince her to come sleep on the floor in my room
I don't know what that says about me
I found out when I went to give her the injection
She totally slept through it
I'm maybe a bad person
But I'm really good at injections
also
also also
David's new name (which we can't use anything but from now on)
is
Amity
Had to ask David how to spell it

had to ask Amity how to spell it so update all your chats to reflect
If you see David in the mornings ask him what he thinks about it
