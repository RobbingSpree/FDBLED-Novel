I'm running late, let me know if she's cute

1:34pm
Is she wearing those clothes I got you?

1:40pm
She is cute. (⁠つ⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠)⁠つ
You coward!! ヘ⁠（⁠。⁠□⁠°⁠）⁠ヘ

1:46pm
Is this a date? (⁠~⁠￣⁠³⁠￣⁠)⁠~
Are you out here today buying her more clothes?
Where did you get money for more clothes.
Ask her if she wants some of mine. (⁠*⁠˘⁠︶⁠˘⁠*⁠)⁠.⁠｡⁠*⁠♡
They might not fit
And I might be using it as an excuse to get a pretty girl to visit my house ♡⁠(⁠˃͈⁠ ⁠દ⁠ ⁠˂͈⁠ ⁠༶⁠ ⁠)
don't tell her I said that

1:53pm

Move aside you utter hat stand
You're blocking the cute girl (⁠ﾉ⁠≧⁠∇⁠≦⁠)⁠ﾉ⁠ ⁠ﾐ⁠ ⁠┻⁠━⁠┻
Why are you wearing a coat?

1:59pm

Don't try to escape me
I look so suspicious hiding back here (⁠゜⁠o⁠゜⁠;
just make a window for me to join in on the conversation

2:04pm

We should have planned how to do this ahead of time

2:05pm

Don't give me that look
Hindsight is 20/20 ┐⁠(⁠´⁠ー⁠｀⁠)⁠┌

2:14pm

You're taking her to buy her first bra?
You said I could date her, this is totally first date activities 
according to the stories I read online it is anyway

2:16pm

I can't just watch and wait while you two have titillating fun without me (⁠ノ⁠ಠ⁠益⁠ಠ⁠)⁠ノ

2:25pm

Where did you go?

2:31pm

I think I saw your girl in the food court, are you still on your date or did you ditch her?

3:11pm

I totally should have introduced myself earlier.
She totally has a crush on you ಠ⁠﹏⁠ಠ

3:12pm

G-Money
What?
Are you insane?
I'm pretty sure Amity hates me.

3:13pm

Flik
Well I hate you too. ಠ⁠ಗ⁠ಠ
Totally failed as a wingman

G-Money
Why are you trying to date a trans woman? Are you looking for exotic women?

Flik
I already dated a trans woman before. I've dated all kinds of women
Except a cougar or a MILF
Couldn't convince anyone's mom to date me yet
But someday...I will become someone's dad by banging their mom ୧⁠(⁠ ⁠ಠ⁠ ⁠Д⁠ ⁠ಠ⁠ ⁠)⁠୨

3:15pm

G-Money
Then why the interest in Amity?

3:17pm

Flik
If you're involved in all of someone's firsts they can't help but think of you often
To stain them your colour as they grow into themselves
Plus I think freshly cracked eggs are the cutest. (⁠~⁠￣⁠³⁠￣⁠)⁠~
I can always tell when someone's secretly trans

G-Money
Really? 100% of the time?

Flik
Every time, I've never been wrong ୧⁠(⁠ ⁠ಠ⁠ ⁠Д⁠ ⁠ಠ⁠ ⁠)⁠୨

3:18pm

Though we should have checked if she was gay before you promised her to me

G-Money
Don't make it sound like I was selling her hand to raise my station

3:19pm

Flik
If we're talking riches, them thighs were pretty good

3:23pm

G-Money
Wait, why do you think Amity isn't gay?
Does is count as gay if she likes girls?

Flik
Yeah, she's a girlthing, i'm a girlthing
If two girlthings like eachother that's gay

G-Money
Chat, is it gay to be gay?

Flik
She kept giving you the eyes man (⁠♡⁠ω⁠♡⁠ ⁠)⁠ ⁠~⁠♪
The "look how physical I am with women and not you" eyes
I would know, I used that to fuck with guys like you all though high school
Don't know why so many guys wanted to try and hook up with me

3:41pm

You're a good egg Gavin.
You treat me like a human, you're barely a guy at all
Or you're ace
Do you get boners? 
Also don't answer that, I regret asking (⁠@⁠_⁠@⁠)

3:43pm

G-Money
You know not saying things is free

What would you say if I told a friend I knew how to take a security tag off a stolen thing but when I tried it didn't come off?

4:30pm

That you assumed it was magnets.
Send me a pic of the widget

Come over tomorrow, I have a 3D printed jig we can use
And as thanks for getting me marked present last week we can detonate the pack afterwards if it's one of the dye pack ones

Ground_Floor()
You know how to cheer a human creature up

4:47pm

Also, who steals a bra?
Took me a sec to work out what that even was.

Ground_Floor()
I saw the price and agreed with them, $150 for underwear is too much

Fork_bomb.zip
You must only buy the cheap stuff.
I bet that thing is hella comphy

4:49pm

Actually, can we lie and say we couldn't get the security tag off and I get to keep it?

The label says it's a 18A, I don't know your sizes but that seems a bit small

Fork_bomb.zip
There's a girl you're friends with who's got a waist as snatched as yours?

4:53pm

You got her number? Don't middleman your way to a date when the people doing the work don't get any profits

Ground_Floor()
She's not a good person, I don't think I like her
This is just one last favor before we part ways forever?

Fork_bomb.zip
Sounds dramatic? She transferring to UoW?

Ground_Floor()
Sometimes I think she never even existed

5:58pm

Fork_bomb.zip
Poetic...but also vague-blogging on main. I ain't gonna touch that

Don't think you can get out of this just by not writing an IOU

Yo, my friend is hosting a rager this weekend. He finally got enough credits to pass this semester, unless he gets hit with a suspension, he can't not graduate.
So take that as a warning.
It's a party, but it's a civil one.
No serious drugs
You wanna come?

GGGGGGGG
Sure, I have had a time of it recently and could do with a bass line so loud it gives me a heart attack.

It'll be your speed, chill vibes and heavy music.
I'll even ask them to slip some jazz into the playlist.

Day-Vid
Sounds fun, but I have to study.

11:28am
But I know a chick who's a bit of a homebody and could probably stand to get out more.
Let me know the deets and I might come if I can convince her to come
I wouldn't stay long, but an appearance is better than nothing

Hey, can I ask a favour? I have to do a costume thing with a friend.
Can you do some makeup for me this weekend?

11:20am

Stephanie
Sure, Dave. Get some reference pics for me and I'll see if we can fit you in

11:24am
You good to pay ten bucks and bring me a coffee?

11:27am
If you know anyone who did Electronic Engineering 210 last year let me know, rumour is the exams have been identical all semester.
