Losers who left without saying anything say what

Gavin

You laid out the worst terms I ever heard and then turned away. It was like you were asking me to go

David

You also left your normal clothes behind

2:53pm

Gavin

Not very feminist of you to call pants and a shirt normal.

Something something intersectionality!

Isn't that what you've been going on about lately?

David

Fine, you left your shame clothes behind in shame.

Are you coming to the normal Sunday dinner or do I need to give them to Lance to give you when they come by on Wednesday?

Gavin

I will never turn down free food

David

You will earn it doing all the dishes

Gavin

Twenty minutes worth of labour is so worth a 2 course meal

Are you crazy??

2:56pm

David

I'm going to dirty every non-essential plate and utensil tomorrow morning

Gavin

Oh no…thirty minutes of labour

You know my job pays like $20 an hour…and a meal as good as we have would cost like $60 at a restaurant.

This is a steal.

3:01pm

David

I'm gonna time you.

Gavin

Bet

David

If you don't get under thirty minutes, you have to wear a skirt for the rest of the night.

3:04pm

Gavin

Don't tell me Aaron was right and they are actually teaching you how to forcefem people in your feminism class.

David

One sec I gotta look something up online

3:10pm

Hahahahahaha. That's an amazing word!!

All I care is that it breaks your concentration and makes you fallible

Gavin

Bold of you to assume that was what shook me

David

This is the scientific method now.

Become my lab rat in unethical sports betting

3:12pm

Gavin

I'm bringing my own cleaning gloves

Your ones are too short in the arm and let water in and have a leak in the right thumb

David

I found a way to make you pay for your crimes.

Meet me at the Pool Hall under the cinema on George St tomorrow night.

And bring easy to remove shoes :)
