Amity
I think you need to make a new account

10:07am

Grace
Your hate mail game needs some work
At least tell me to kill myself

Amity
You've still got the same username as when you were Gavin. I bet when I add you to the group chat with Marissa and Jillian it'll default to saying Gavin joined the chat. 
You got an explanation for that in the chamber?

Grace
Hmmmm, that is a good point. 
(Also that's their names? That's not even close to what they were calling one another)
But I'm pretty sure you can see an account's age, how do I explain making an account today?

10:17am

Amity
Grace, you might have forgotten cause computer people tend to, but most of the rest of us didn't have an account for this before getting to uni. 
I had someone in a tutorial last week have to make an account on the spot so they could be sent a link to the class collective notes page.

Grace
Fair point, Amity. Okay, now I just have to work out a username and I'll let you know.

Saturday 24th April 12:03am

Amity
Did you think of one?

8:53am

Grace
Naming things is hard, okay

10:02pm

Amity
You picked names for both yourself and me with less effort than this
Actually, can I just pick a username for you?

Grace
It can't be something that's gonna make everything difficult like amitys_girlfriend02

Amity
I've had more girlfriends than that

10:08pm

Grace
David had all those girlfriends. Amity is new to this whole thing

Amity
I'm gonna think of something terrible. Your life could use a little more difficulty

Hey Mom, would asking your friends to force you to dress like a girl by cheating at poker sound like asking for permission?

10:09am

Mom_2rd
That sounds like the most egg thing I've ever heard.
I'm also jealous, that sounds entirely plausible. I'm mad I didn't think of that when I was your age ;n;

Hey, guys. David invited a lady friend over, she's currently playing a prank on him. She's got an explainer written out. Read it and follow it, I think it'll be worth it.

*Jillian has been renamed Jelly*

She_who_Jelly_refuses_to_vivisect
Are you thinking what I'm thinking B1?

Jelly
I think I am B2

*Marissa has been renamed Marsupial*

Marsupial
Grace is a lesbian

3:03pm

Jelly
That's not what I was thinking actually
I can hold my thought, explain yourself Marmar

Marsupial
So we agree that Grace's plan was essentially to forcefemme David

Jelly
Hang on...I think I know what that means but I want to be sure

*Marissa has been renamed Porn Reader*

okay go on, porn reader

3:04pm

Porn Reader
Rude
Anyway, there's no way a straight woman would want to turn a guy into a woman for non-sex reasons
Let's not ignore that she already had a name picked out

Jelly
I thought it was a good idea
He was starting to get on my nerves with the feminism stuff

Porn Reader
You against feminism, my child?
(loads gun)

3:05pm

Jelly
No, the way he was going about it was infuriating
Yes, David, I know what the patriarchal hegemony is, this isn't news
I wanted to gently beat him with a lead pipe to make him stop
This seems as good a way as any

Porn Reader
Anyway, if grace is a lesbian and she's trying to turn David into a girl she can date...we are in a hilarious position to "help"
Wanna make a bet?

3:07pm

Jelly
I have no idea where you're going with this

Porn Reader
I bet I can inject David with more Estradiol Enanthate and get away with it than you can 

3:09pm

Jelly
Hang on...I need to look another thing up

*Marissa has been renamed 5mL_weekly*

Okay...counter point, we can't both inject David with Estrogen, he'll get breast cancer or something

3:10pm

I'm gonna inject it into Grace instead

5mL_weekly
I fail to see where you're going with that.
Grace did puberty already
It didn't do much for her obviously
But she's a good girl...I wanna inject her too
She's like a friendly skeleton

Jelly
You can't inject everyone with hormones
That's not fair
Share! You criminal!
I let you practice subcutaneous injections on me, I deserve to do crimes too

3:11pm

5mL_weekly
Okay, you inject David and I do Grace
...why are we injecting Grace?

3:12pm

Jelly
She looks malnourished as fuck
I don't think she's ever had a period with how thin she looks
So we help kick start her endocrine system while David feeds her enough food that she has some fat to redistribute
fool proof plan

5mL_weekly
Assuming we're not fools

3:14pm

Jelly
Do you remember what the name Grace had picked out for David was?

5mL_weekly
No, but when David adds her to the group chat I'm gonna ask and never let him have his display name as anything else
I think I see the fun in this forcefemme stuff
I can't forcefemme you...can I?

Jelly
Don't make me change your display name again

3:18pm

And remember to actually grab a vial of Estradiol Enanthate from the fridge while you're back there.
