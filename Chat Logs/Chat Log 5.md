I think you need to make a new account

Grace
Your hate mail game needs some work
At least tell me to kill myself

Amity
You've still got the same number as when you were going by Gavin. I bet when I add you to the group chat with Marissa and Jillian it'll default to saying Gavin joined the chat. 
You got an explanation for that in the chamber.

Grace
Hmmmm, that is a good point. 
(Also that's their names? That's not even close to what they were calling one another)
But I'm pretty sure you can see an account's age, how do I explain making an account today?

Amity
Grace, you might have forgotten cause computer people tend to, but most of the rest of us didn't have an account for this before getting to uni. 
I had someone in a tutorial have to make an account on the spot so they could be sent a link to the class collective notes page.

Grace
Fair point, Amity. Okay, now I just have to work out a username and I'll let you know.

(The following day)

Amity
Did you think of one?

Grace
Naming things is hard, okay

Amity
You picked names for both yourself and me with less effort than this
Actually, can I just pick a username for you?

Grace
It can't be something that's gonna make everything difficult like amitys_girlfriend02

Amity
I've had more girlfriends than that

Grace
David had all those girlfriends. Amity is new to this whole thing

Amity
I'm gonna think of something terrible. You could use a little more difficulty

Hey Mom, would asking your friends to force you to dress like a girl by cheating at poker sound like asking for permission?

Mom_2rd
That sounds like the most egg thing I've ever heard.
I'm also jealous, that sounds entirely plausible. I'm mad I didn't think of that.

Hey, guys. David invited a lady friend over, she's currently playing a prank on him. She's got an explainer written out. Read it and follow it, I think it'll be worth it.
