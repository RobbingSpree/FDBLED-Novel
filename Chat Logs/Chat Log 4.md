G-Money 
Is it normal to cry after being kissed?

8:59pm

Flik
Is that where you got to?
You said you were going to dance? How did you end up making out with someone so poorly they cried.

G-Money 
The kiss wasn't that bad

Flik
You said you'd never dated anyone. I don't think you've got the experience to say you weren't bad enough at it to make her cry

9:03pm

There'll be other chances, next year once you can afford to come back to uni, but there will be other chances. And you get the chance to improve.

G-Money
She didn't hate it.

Flik
Did she say that when you asked why she was crying.
She was just trying to be nice.
No one wants to hurt a guy's feelings cause you can be dangerous.

Did you see who Gavin ended up dancing with?

Aaron
I saw them seemingly being pinned to the wall by Dylan

Felicity
Can't say I agree with their tastes
