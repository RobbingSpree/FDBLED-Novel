G-Money 
Is it normal to cry after being kissed?

8:59pm

Flik
Is that where you got to?
You said tonight was going to be the last chance we'd get to see you and then you fucked off?
You said you were going to dance? How did you end up making out with someone so poorly they cried.

G-Money 
The kiss wasn't that bad

Flik
You said you'd never dated anyone. I don't think you've got the experience to say you weren't bad enough at it to make her cry

G-Money 
They also said it wasn't something special 

9:03pm
Flik
I think they lied. You just did it wrong. It happens.
There'll be other chances, next year once you can afford to come back to uni, you can find another random and weirdly forward girl. And you'll get the chance to vindicate your efforts.

G-Money
She didn't hate it. It was just a lot all at once.

Flik
Did she say that when you asked why she was crying.
She was just trying to be nice.
No one wants to hurt a guy's feelings cause you can be dangerous. Just let it go.

Felicity
Did you see who Gavin ended up dancing with?

Friday 9:07pm

Aaron
I think I saw them seemingly being pinned to the wall by Dylan
I was gonna intervene but they left before I got close

Felicity
Can't say I agree with their tastes
But now I wanna know if I misunderstood their text message

Baby
Hey Mom, how can I help a friend I think is trans from a distance?

8:37pm
Mom_2rd
How much of a distance? 
What makes you think they're trans?

8:38pm
Baby
They're moving back with their family and I've seen them trying out being a girl with Gavin

Mom_2rd
Gavin? The one who lives with the man hating women? 

Baby
That has to be the worst way to describe them. But yeah.

8:42pm
Mom_2rd
Trans folk are often just looking for permission to exist so don't question them and just follow their lead and encourage them if the opportunity arises.
Your mom was one of my best supporters when I was threatening to come out of the closet.
I'm proud you're trying to help, and remember, if you don't know what to say: pretend you forgot everything and give them a compliment.
Works every time.

8:46pm
Baby
I'll always try. 
I love you mom

Mom_2rd
Love you too, Aaron

Daystar
Hey, Marissa...I've got a favour to ask.

Marmar
Don't use my whole name, it sounds like I've done something wrong. 
Shorten it to Mar at least 

Daystaro
Mar, I have a favour to ask

Marmar
You didn't have to ask twice

Daystar
I feel like sometimes I do

Marmar
You do, but not this time

9:05pm

Daystar
Regardless, my friend got evicted from her apartment cause the landlord kept raising rent and they need somewhere to crash. 

Marmar
Yes

Daystar
Can they stay with us at least till the end of semester?

9:06pm

You didn't even let me finish

Marmar
I didn't realise it was an actual favour.
I thought you were gonna ask if you could eat the grape pudding I've been hiding in the fridge or something 

Daystar
I know better than to eat your food
Okay, gotta ask Jill next. 
thanks

9:15pm 
Marmar
What kind of person is she? Is there anything I should know before I meet her?

9:21pm
Daystar
She's a bit of a mischief maker. But that might just be with me
We've been in a little bit of a battle to the death for the last few weeks
(The death battle is unrelated to her being homeless)

Marmar
I know how much of a waste of existence landlords are, you're preaching to the choir

Friday 23rd April 9:07pm

Daywalker 
Mar already said yes, but I need to get your go ahead for a favour
I have a friend who got evicted and needs a place to crash, can she stay with us at least until the end of semester?

9:38pm

Jillian-hands-on-buns
Don't care
If Mar says it's good, that probably enough 
She puts more thought into this stuff
We're heading home at the moment btw
Can you pop the frozen pies in the oven for us?
You'd be a godsend

David looked really weird this morning 

She_who_Jelly_refuses_to_vivisect
Did he have pants on?
He's really spacey in the morning 

She_who_mar_wont_touch
He was really smiley and excited
Like a maiden in love before a date

She_who_Jelly_refuses_to_vivisect
Guys are allowed to have crushes you know.
Are you sure he wasn't planning what to cook tomorrow? He gets kind of intense about his big meals

She_who_mar_wont_touch
It's suspicious is all
