G-Money 
Is it normal to cry after being kissed?

8:59pm

Flik
Is that where you got to?
You said you were going to dance? How did you end up making out with someone so poorly they cried.

G-Money 
The kiss wasn't that bad
They said it was a just a casual thing

Flik
You said you'd never dated anyone. I don't think you've got the experience to say you weren't bad enough at it to make her cry

9:03pm

There'll be other chances, next year once you can afford to come back to uni, but there will be other chances. And you get the chance to improve.

G-Money
She didn't hate it. It was just a lot all at once.

Flik
Did she say that when you asked why she was crying.
She was just trying to be nice.
No one wants to hurt a guy's feelings cause you can be dangerous.

Felicity
Did you see who Gavin ended up dancing with?

Aaron
I think I saw them seemingly being pinned to the wall by Dylan
I was gonna intervene but they left before I got close

Felicity
Can't say I agree with their tastes
But now I wanna know if I misunderstood their text message

Baby
Hey Mom, how can I help a friend I think is trans from a distance?

Mom_2rd
How much of a distance? 
What makes you think they're trans?

Baby
They're moving back with their family and I've seen them trying out being a girl with Gavin

Mom_2rd
Gavin? The one who lives with the man hating women? 

Baby
That has to be the worst way to describe them. But yeah.

Mom_2rd
Trans folk are often just looking for permission to exist so don't question them and just follow their lead and encourage them if the opportunity arises.
