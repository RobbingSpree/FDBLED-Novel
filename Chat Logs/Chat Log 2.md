Gavin

Yo, where'd you go?

Actually hang on, I'm gonna change your contact name on my phone so I don't forget this victory.

_David has been renamed Amity_

7:15pm

Amity

I went home, I still have to cook dinner for my roommates. Fridays are a big cook up, you should know, you've stayed to partake several times.

Actually give me a sec to change your name too, I can't be left out of a chance at bullying.

_Gavin has been renamed Grace_

Grace

Haha, very funny.

I just called myself that on a whim, I actually thought about a name that would suit you.

7:21pm

Amity

I just looked it up. It's the virtue of fellowship?

Grace

And being a good host and friend.

Amity

How was that something you just knew off hand?

7:22pm

Grace

Comp-sci students aren't known for their rich interpersonal lives, so I read a fuck-load of books instead of making friends as a teen and early 20th century writers were allergic to using the same word twice I swear.

I spent half the time reading with a dictionary and thesaurus open next to me

Amity

And mastered every game under the sun too apparently.

Grace

That was more my sister. She was a wiz at anything that required hand-eye coordination. I had to at least get on her level or the bullying would never stop.

Actually you're very similar to my sister.

Amity

I don't know how to take that.

Is that a compliment? Did she have other qualities besides being a bully?

7:23pm

Grace

No, in the sense that she also used to wager nonsense embarrassing stuff on games of skill.

8:06pm

Amity

Also, I don't know what you were on about. Walking home like this was a fucking breeze. How was this the thing that drove you to revenge?

8:11pm

Grace

Thems fighting words.

All you did was flee.

Straight shot from town to home

I had to stand at the bus stop and I aware everyone was staring add to that the walk from the bus stop home where I was catcalled

Amity

Didn't you drive to my place last week?

Grace

Is that where my car is?

Goddamn!

I didn't have to go though all that?

Fuck

Amity

That's amazing.

Glad to know you are fallible. That there's weaknesses I can leverage.

Grace

Try not to sound too evil there, Amity.

8:12pm

Amity

You said it was my name ONLY while I was wearing that getup, GRACE.

Grace

I'm imagining you're wearing it right now.

And since this phone can't receive photos, you can't prove otherwise. So I can use whatever name I feel like and you can't stop me.

If you think it's easy to exist in public when you're Amity, I challenge you to a window shop!

Amity

Okay…smh

Explain what you mean before I agree to anything

Grace

We'll meet up at in the CBD tomorrow at 1pm, change clothes and go window shopping until one of us chickens out

Amity

What's the stakes?

Grace

We've got time. We can come up with something to fight for by midday tomorrow.

Flik

Did she like it?

Did she look cute?

Did you tell her I wanted to meet her?

G-Money

Chill, no.

Flik

She didn't look cute?

7:35pm

G-Money

I didn't say that.

Flik

Then call her cute (⁠ﾉ⁠◕⁠ヮ⁠◕⁠)⁠ﾉ⁠*⁠.⁠✧

7:37pm

I believe in you

Call the cute girl cute

G-Money

It's the principal of the thing. I'm not going to say stuff that I might regret.

Flik

How could you regret being nice to a trans girl?

Trans girls deserve all the love (⁠つ⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠)⁠つ

And I'm going to give it to them

By force if I have to (⁠~⁠￣⁠³⁠￣⁠)⁠~

7:38pm

G-Money

You know those emoji are just squares on my end. I don't have the font pack for them.

Flik

When I buy a new phone you can have this one.

Did you at least take a photo of her in the clothes? Did she take a photo? Did she have a girl name picked out yet?

G-Money

A photo was one of the penalties, but we played too slow for me to win that. So no photos, sorry

7:41pm

I picked her name though.

Flik

Wow, she must trust you a lot if she let you give her her very first girl clothes and pick her name. What was her short list?

7:43pm

G-Money

Ehh…about that…

Flik

Did you bully her into letting you pick her name?

This is supposed to be an important time for a burgeoning girl.

Don't beat me to the punch, I wanted to bully her ヘ⁠（⁠。⁠□⁠°⁠）⁠ヘ

G-Money

I won the right to name her by beating her at a game.

Flik

I almost stopped reading at her and thought you won this with violence.

wait…why was it decided with a game?

7:53pm

Don't leave me hanging, give me the goss (⁠ᗒ⁠ᗩ⁠ᗕ⁠)

8:15pm

G-Money

She's called Amity

And I'm meeting up with her again tomorrow if you wanted to perv on her from a distance.

8:17pm

Flik

Bet!
